      "Review :  WOW. THE ONLY THING THAT IS KEEPING THESE GUYS OPEN IS THEIR LOCATION AND FOOD NETWORK FAME.\\n\\nMost of their customers are mainly gonna be tourists and first timers. Located in a busy part of the Fremont Street Experience, the name of the restaurant and the words \\\"350 Pounds and Over Eat Free\\\" are definite eye catchers.\\n\\nThe Heart Attack Grill or \\\"HAG\\\" as it's come to be known, has actually lived up to it's namesake with actual heart attack incidents. As a matter of fact, while I am typing this review, I find out the unofficial spokesperson for HAG has died from you guessed it, an apparent heart attack. \\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20130212/nv-heart-attack-grill-heart-attack/?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=politics\\n\\nThis place must be bad because I have gone at least 3 paragraphs before even having to mention their food. Ok, quick descriptions. They cook their beef patties and fries with lard. Their milkshakes have actual butter in them. Literally they have a little stick of butter right on top of it sticking out. Now I know the fat is what makes most greasy food taste good but in this case the grease is highly overpowering.\\n\\nService is decent. Yeah you got scantily clad female nurses as your servers but this is Vegas. Nothing should surprise you. Well, maybe except for when you see guys getting spanked by them with wooden paddles because it's their birthday. You can actually get spanked if you ask nicely. No special occasion necessary.\\n\\nOf course everybody's number one complaint is that they take cash only. Of course there is an ATM available but you get charged up the arse just in fees alone. FAIL.\\n\\nSo overall, most people come just for the shock value. Meaning they are shocked when they shouldnt be when they find out there has been several heart attack incidents. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.\n",

My ever observant companions  took that as a definite NO and fortunately we went elsewhere.\\n\\nIs it just me? Do I not know what a good burger tastes like or what good service consists of? After reading the good reviews here  guess I don't but the two times I have been there in three years I have had the most greasy, overpriced burgers accompanied by slow, indifferent service I have ever had.  I ordered a medium-rare and got a bloody, greasy glob that pretty much dissolved the bun. The meat was tasteless and the only thing that saved it was the sauce. Oh, and it took a mere forty-five minutes to get to me. The first visit wasn't much better.\\n I think though that it may have something to do with going there on Sunday nights which can be a crap-shoot at any restaurant in Madison. Maybe I'll try it again on a weekday but since I had one of  the worst meals of my LIFE at this place I'm not eager to test my luck again.\\nIf you have to go, stick to the fried mushrooms.\n",

I drive a long-bed crew cab truck so it's not like I ever expect it to be easy, but WTF? They have spaces facing a wall, which are easy to get to, but then have more spaces behind those for parallel parking and there isn't room for a go kart to back up when someone uses those other spaces. \\n\\nWhen you go inside it smells incredible, but when you get your food it just smells like pure butter. I am not even sure why I ate my dinner. It was a mix of ingredients that just didn't work. I had a carne asada burrito, probably not their specialty, but read enough of my reviews and you see thats almost all I eat. It was almost half beans, then a bunch of guacamole, and some very tasteless meat. It was a cardboard/bean/avocado burrito. The tortilla had so much damn butter on it that it tasted like a butter stick. I'm not looking forward to seeing my cardiologist report after this. \\n\\nProbably the one redeeming quality I see is the little 11 year old girl that was the cashier/order taker actually spoke english. The rest of the staff were not bi-lingual, and while they don't need to be, it seems funny that the entire menu is in English. I have no problem saying carne asada, but why type \\\"grilled steak\\\" on the menu if you don't want me to order it that way?\n",

When we arrived we were promptly seated and the waitress came by at took our drink order. We all ordered water and then ordered our meals.\\n\\nWe were then IGNORED for 45+ minutes while we waited for our food. No check ups by the waitress, no I am sorry your food is taking so long. hey do you need a refill, no nothing. At that point since we were out of time and had to get back to the office so we got up to leave. That is when we were finally noticed. The waitress came running over almost freaking out  saying our food is just about ready. Where were you 20 minutes ago?\\n\\nAnyway one guy in my party had guilt over leaving and paid for the whole order to go. I disagree that he should of done that since we were not into them for anything because we were all drinking water but that was his choice.\\n\\nI understand that sometimes freshly made food takes a bit longer when its prepared fresh, but not 40 minutes. but there is no excuse to ignore someone for that amount of time.\\n\\nP.S. In response to the owner's comments, I stand by what I said in my review as accurate. So based on what the owner says, good customer service is to call me a liar, write a snarky insincere response, and rally against yelp and other review sites complaining about how unfair they are?  I have read all the owner's comments left towards other Yelpers and there is a consistent theme throughout them. If something goes wrong during your visit, don't blame the restaurant. Not a very productive response in my opinion. I think highly of yelp as yet another tool for consumers to made educated decisions about where to spend their hard earned money. It is also good for businesses that go above and beyond because they will always be rewarded with my repeat business.\n",

I told my Threapist that I was having back pain in my lower back. All he concentrated on was that area and nothing else. Being a professional, I thought he would know he had to massage the surrounding area in order for me to feel relief.  I left with my lower back feeling better but the rest of my back was in A LOT of pain and still is. I was not happy with my experience at all.\\nAlso, as a member I thought I would be taken care of better but I was treated no better than a non-member. My membership doesn't get me anything special. Pay three times as much as a membership to LVAC and don't even get as many massages as you want. Or at least go twice a week. Total rip off. Pay full price and only perks come if you refer someone and they sign up. Don't waste your money here. If you're in pain, look up a chiropractor that has massages in office.\n",

      "Review :  I visited La Calabria with high hopes of finding my \\\"go to\\\" italian restaurant, but I can now cross it off my lisit of places to dine. I did so based off the countless high reviews it had been given on yelp and google.  I started my night off by ordering the beef carpaccio however what arrived was battered fried cheese with a bowl of canned tomato sauce.   I decided to eat this concoction because our waiter was new and clearly nervous.  The appetizer tasted about as good as it looked which i would rate as average at best.   Next we were served out salads, the house and caesar.  Both salads followed right in line with our appetizer, average but severly overdressed.   Our main course consisted of the Linguini ai Frutti di Mare and Meat Ravioli, which our server recommended.  The ravioli was what i would expect from an Olive Garden caliber restaurant.  The Ligunie is where I took offense.  The basic concepts of cooking this dish were missing.  This is my favoite dish and something I consider a staple of a good Italian restaurant.  The pasta was overcooked to a mushy consistency.  The Seafood was generous however was also overcooked.  All of this was served in what appeared to be a tomatoy soup that was filled to the brim of the bowl.  I ate the entire meal with fear I would have this red water in my lap or all over the table. \\nI am confused by the numerous high ratings for La Calabria.  I have grown up eating great italian and recently moved to Phoenix.  If my only experience of italian food  was eating Chuck E Cheese I might be more inclined to give 3 stars.   If you are looking for a great Italian meal look elsewhere.\n",

I had been wanting for sometime to try \\\"Angelina's Pizza\\\" and was delighted to see they had what they called a \\\"Angelina's Pizza Express\\\". The cashier was very friendly.  They sell pizza by the slice which sits under a heat lamp until ordered. I recommend buying a whole pie if there is more then one of you since leftover pizza rocks. \\nWe decided on a large pepperoni. It was 18 inches and cost $29.58 for the pizza and 2 fountain drinks. We waited in the food court seating area until the pizza was done baking. The tables and floor were filthy. The cashier brought us our pizza and again was very friendly. The pizza was pure grease. There was barely any sauce on it. I thought it was a waste of money personally.  \\n\\nWith other options on the strip the Riv is going to have to step up its game!\n",

I told the cashier that I wanted to sit down, and rather than being courteous and finding me a seat, she told me that the tables are for people that order food from a waitress.  Ridiculous!  I guess spending $15 for a sandwich, fries and potato salad isn't enough for me to to sit down at their establishment and enjoy my meal.    \\n\\nI wouldn't recommend this place based on the customer service alone.

The food is still good ofcourse it's just amount of food that we got and the service. It wasn't the same as before. Me and my bf came in around 1am, because I just had gotten off work and I wanted to get some food before i went home.. When went in the restaurant we felt the vibe that we were not welcome.. and when the person served our food.. the guy started cleaning all the tables and making us and other people seem like intruders in the restaurant.. so me and my bf had to chow down everything in like 10 mins. The guy decide to lock the doors and it wasn't even 2 yet... I just don't understand the hours here.. \\n\\nIf you want business.. then treat customers with priority.. Don't make them feel as if they need to hurry the eff up so you can get your asses home even if the store hours says that you should still be open anyway.. I mean i would come back but for the service.. I would rather try a different location or just stay with L&L..  better service and with good quality food.\n",

Service was lackluster. It took a long time to get anyone's attention for even simple things like a water refill, and even longer to get orders and our food. Granted there was a large group there but the restaurant wasn't overly crowded other than that.\\n The food was mediocre as well. All of the salsas they brought to the table were spicy. There was spicy and spicier, but no mild. The fajitas my husband ordered came with generous portions of meat and veggies but only 3(!) small corn tortillas. Nowhere near enough for the amount of food. My green burrito tasted primarily like poblano peppers. There was really no other flavor in the dish, and I just couldn't eat it. The waiter took away my dish with only 1 bite out of the burrito and didn't so much as ask if I liked it or if there was a problem. Not a good experience overall, and certainly not one that would encourage me to come back.\n",

The experience I had was not stellar at all.\\n\\nI opted for the breaded chicken salad after contemplating several other items on the menu.  I should have stuck to a sandwich from here.  When the salad arrived, the dressing was missing.  A very important key ingredient to any salad is the dressing.  With me being at work and on a limited amount of time to consume my salad on my lunch break, I had to rummage through the work fridge for some type of salad dressing to top this off.\\n\\nFrom the description on the menu you are to receive a handful of fries along with all the other ingredients for this salad.  If they consider this a handful of fries, I consider that they have a two year old working there.  I counted, and there were no more than eight total fries on this salad.  The breaded chicken was actually good.  It appears that they may make it on site (I cannot confirm this), but is was lightly breaded.  Not like the chicken tenders at most other restaurants.  Easily the best part of the salad.\\n\\nOne other shining star to this salad was that they give you a pita on the side instead of bread.  Giving you the option of putting the salad in the pocket and eating while doing other tasks.  But it wasn't shining enough to give this place more than two stars in my opinion.\n",

A gal came and took our drink order and our soft drinks came out right away. A house margarita took 15 minutes. Yikes. To say that the service was slow would be an extreme understatement. \\nAfter finally getting our margarita, our real server took our food order. I got stacked enchiladas, wifey and daughter each ordered a green corn tamale. Also, a ala carte taco and beef flautas. I asked for a side of honey as I had to cool my mouth from the ridiculously hot green salsa.\\n\\nHere's where it gets bad, real bad.  The honey comes in this little black ramekin, color is key here. I dipped a few chips in the honey and had succeeded to cool my mouth off, when i saw a small black ant type bug crawling on my hand. I simply squashed it and was about to dip another chip when i saw several dozen ants doing laps around the ramekin.  After killing as many as I could find, I called the server over and told her what was up. She was incredulous that there were any bugs and took the bowl away.\\nOh, our food was still MIA after 25 minutes. During that time a manager type came by with the server in tow, and asked the server while standing at our table, \\\"Is this the bug guy?\\\" She proceeded to explain that she had personally prepared the honey bowls only an hour prior and that she couldnt believe that there were bugs in the bowls. Thankfully the server had looked into the ramekin when she had taken it back to kitchen and found more and told the manager that there were indeed bugs.  The manager made no offer to comp or toss in a dessert or app, i guess cause our food was still mia.\\nOk, i guess we should have left, but we were starving and our food finally came:  My stacked enchiladas was very average, the best thing in the plate was the rice.  The tortillas were so tough, i had to use a knife to cut them. The two green con tamales, well.... i could only tell that it was a tamale because it was served on a corn husk. The cook had chopped it up into some unrecognizable mush that was bland whose only taste came from the overdose of hot peppers.\\nThe beef taco was reported to be ok, but again it was so spicy that it took away from the taste. The best food item was the flauta, no one can screw up a deep fried rolled up corn tortilla right??\\nTo sum up, over priced, bug infested, super spicy to cover up the lack of taste, very long delays and rude manager. Never to return. I will try and keep as many of my friends from going as well.\n",

The onions were over cooked and they even had the nerve to placed wilted lettuce on my plate. They forgot my black beans and when the waitress finally brought them, I took one bite and spit them out. They had so much cumin in them it was inedible. The waitresses seemed uninterested in doing a good job and it pained my party and I to even leave any kind of tip.

Despite the reviews on Yelp this place got Best of Las Vegas (at least if my memory serves me right) so we decided to try it. It was at a premium price, for this place, around $16 for the weekend seafood buffet. We went on Saturday night, no wait but extremely busy. Service was poor, I had to track someone down when I wanted a drink refill and in the middle of dinner they took my soy sauce away. I thought to fill it or exchange and bring it back, but no it was just gone.  They had less selection of Chinese food than I expected, maybe because there was more seafood. A lot of people were eating the snow crab, but that is just way too much work for me for so little reward, I am a king crab or nothing kind of girl unless it is already cracked open. They also had salt and pepper frog legs, which was different, although I didn't try it. The only thing that I liked was some sort of seafood medly on a shell with a baked on mayonnaise sauce. I recently saw a poster that bacon was the duct tape of food, and if that is so I think mayonnaise is like the glue - it helps quite a bit to repair food that would otherwise lack in flavor. They had a small sushi bar, and it was well meh - I guess I should be thankful there was any sushi, and there were a few different kinds - tako, salmon, tuna, eel, a number of norimaki rolls. The rolls were okay. Also, I tried the white fish but I wasn't sure what type of white fish it was, maybe Tilapia, but it really wasn't that good. They had salt and pepper squid, which again was okay.  So yes - overall I would say, some items were okay at best but I won't ever be coming back.\n",

      "Review :  So after being seated, we asked the hostess what appetizers we could get pretty quickly and she named 2 and that was great. Once our waitress arrived we ordered drinks, the waitress brought us water and our drinks and came back for our orders a minute or two later. We ordered the calamari and 4 dishes. The calamari came first about 10 minutes later, then bread. The calamari was pretty disappointing, the calamari itself was kind of watery tasting. After we were almost done with the app, the waitress brought some bread and oil, which was very tasty - we had a few servings! Then came the salads. I personally really liked the salad and the house Italian dressing, but it is very Rosemary based, which some may not like.\\n\\nThen came our entrees. I got the scarpariello dish with a side of pasta - I really liked the sausage but the chicken was kind of meh. My friends had: bolognese, pesto, and puttanesca. It seems like the puttanesca was a win from the crowds reactions, but the others were also meh. It sounds fancy (naming) but I could've made the same thing at home easily. \\n\\nMy main complaint is the order of food. I've worked in an Italian restaurant before, you always bring the bread first! Especially if the waitress is busy the hostess should go grab some bread ASAP. Then salads, then apps, then entree. To be fair it seemed like the hostess was new. \\n\\nDoubtful I'd go again for $15/entree mediocre food and service.\n",

We come back routinely for our same dishes we always get and last night had the same service that almost turned me away from this place the first time. Last nights food was also off so i felt like i was in the twilight zone and i was at Crazy Fish but i wasn't at the same time. Idk who reads these but check the schedule for who was closing last night on the 6th of Feb and i would do some re-evaluating on the kitchen staff and wait staff. The older woman looked lost while the little blonde was running circles around her...needless to say we had the lost looking waitress.

When we walked in, we were greeted by the manager with an unintelligible grunt and a vague wave that we took as \\\"sit wherever\\\". We sat there for 5 minutes before anyone even acknowledged our presence. By then we were already debating whether we should stay or go. When a waitress finally showed up to our table, we were at our limit with our patience. We told her we needed a few more moments, which we used to confirm our decision to leave. On our way out, she said \\\"change your mind folks\\\" in a condensing and disgruntled tone. We will not be returning and I think we now understand why there weren't very many customers there.\n",

      "Review :  Most of this is Fox's fault, though I will try and share the wealth where appropriate. It began with an Expedia deal involving what we quickly came to realize was a hotel well past it's shelf life - Luxor - followed by a car rental from Fox for a drive from Las Vegas for this past weekend's Coachella Festival. After taking the airport shuttle from Luxor to the airport, we wound up boarding two different shuttles to get to Fox. This nuisance has been spelled out clearly here on Yelp, and shame on me for not checking first. But while that was certainly annoying, things were about to get worse. \\n\\nThe clerk at Fox grew belligerent and cut my fianc\\u00e9e off when she balked at a few extra fees that were not mentioned in the Expedia arrangement, and it made the situation quite unpleasant from there on in, including an attempt to upsell us on extra insurance, a $10-per-day fee for an additional driver and a higher-end car. We declined each of these offers. \\n\\nWe were then directed outside to the car pickup zone, where we were met by a cheerful young gentleman who told us we'd \\\"lucked out\\\" because he didn't believe there were any economy cars available. No such luck, we discovered, though since we'd only requested an economy car, we were fine with that. Of course that was because we'd never experienced a Chevy Spark. \\n\\nThe Chevy Spark, if you're fortunate enough never to have crossed paths with one, has one redeeming feature: It gets good gas mileage. That's because it is a child's toy with a lawnmower engine. The car - and I use that term as loosely as humanly possible - shifts gears at around 65-70 mph, but even on flat ground it labors to do so. If you're driving up a hill, it coughs and wheezes like Doc Holliday in heavy pollen season. The engine sounds as though it will explode. It is absolutely brutal. \\n\\nI've rented some real pieces of shit, owned a couple of beaters, but please believe me when I tell you: the Chevy Spark is the worst fucking car I have ever driven. A small wind throws the car around like a small fishing boat in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle. The wheels are the size of fancy gluten-free birthday cakes made for two. The radio won't fucking shut off. Perhaps the wipers work well, but Fox gave us a car with a totally empty well. Alas...\\n\\nThere is no zero-star option on Yelp, so I'm going to try and convince myself into believing the quick, painless dropoff earned this terrible company a single star.\n",

      "Review :  I had been here before and wasn't thrilled for the most part but some friends told me about the fish on Friday.  I sat at  the bar which was mostly regulars enjoying pleasant conversation and unwinding after the work day. Not being a regular, the bartender definitely addressed me much different and in a very sterile manner.  While I appreciate a hard earned vacation, I don't care to hear the bartender talk about her upcoming getaway because \\\"this place is making her crazy\\\" with the regulars. Doesn't make a good first impression and if it's not a pleasant work environment it makes me the customer question what's coming out of the kitchen.  That was soon answered.\\n\\n\\nThe fish, fries and slaw arrived and made a nice first impression based on appearance. That's where it ended, the fresh cut fries were barely warm and extremely limp. The cole slaw has no business being called slaw. Shredded cabbage in a bowl would be more appropriate, no flavor at all.   The two tiny corn fritters/hush puppies were beyond bland and rubbery.  \\n\\nNow let's discuss the fish.  It looked good, the portion was very reasonable for the price. That's where it ends. Like the fries the fish was barely warm. The fish lacked texture and flavor.  I am accustomed to a fish that has some flakiness to it. This fish was more like Mrs Paul's. \\n\\nI have tried lunch, fail, now dinner,fail.  I will be back to try breakfast and let you know.\n",

I have been lied to by several employees about what I am being sold and will NEVER return here.   \\n\\nTwo prime examples:  \\n\\n1) I was told that since I had a tablet and phone on the same account, I could add a home line and my bill could be \\\"bundled and reduced by about $20-30 a month\\\" so it was \\\"silly not to do this deal\\\". Well, I took the bait and ended up with an extra line I didn't need and actually INCREASED my bill by $20-30 a month instead of reduced it, like I was told. I tried to cancel after the first month and my bill was ridiculous however it was outside of the 14 day return policy and I had to pay an extra $150 to do so!!   \\n\\nWell, silly silly me decided to go back since I needed a new phone and they are the closet store to me....... bad idea!!   \\n\\n2) I just purchased a new phone 13 days ago from this store and they refuse to return in even though the phone clearly has internal issues and registers touches all over the screen at random given moments - making emailing business clients impossible since it sometimes sends messages or types things I didn't ask it to do. I found out today, which I was NOT told initially, that I also no longer have a warranty on this phone since it was purchased on a different line and switched to the one I primarily use (since I needed an upgrade and didn't have one).   \\n\\nMind you, I had to purchase a new phone because someone screwed up at the store and didn't put the insurance on my phone when I asked for it multiple times (I'm adamant about this because I have terrible luck with phones). If I had had insurance, I could have gotten my phone replaced. Since I didn't, I had to get this new phone that is also messed up.

There are only two elevators in the hotel that the hotel employees and guests share which makes getting to your floor anywhere from 5-15 min. Almost every day was a rude awakening when my room keys reset and would not let me in my room. This would not have been such a big issue except for the time that it took to get the elevator to show up to my floor and then return to my floor. \\n\\nOut of a week of staying in this hotel, my room was only cleaned twice and that was when I requested this.

I fortunately spoke Spanish but it was embarrassing for me to stumble through a conversation with the cleaners when I just needed a box of tissues and some toilet paper.\\n\\nThe elegant look of the hotel is summed up in one word...IKEA. Everything is cheaply decorated so you can bask in opulent trash while waiting for your elevator to show up.\\n\\nThe staff is very pleasant and does make you feel welcome. That is the only good thing about the place. Parking is $22 a day which is a total waste of money and the hotel bill was double charged for several days of parking.\\n\\nIn closing, I would not wish this hotel on my worst enemy.\n",

This alone should contribute to an atmosphere of authenticity.

The lights by the bed won't work though which is interesting. There is one lamp by the TV which seems to work. \\n\\nOther reviewers mentioned the pool being restrictive and it definitely is. They have a security guard who stands out front of it and big signs enforcing their \\\"rules\\\". They also have signs in the lobby noting their dress code after 8pm. Seems a bit much for me and way off the strip.\n",

I ordered the bacon ranch quesadilla and after a couple of bites there was this nasty hard stuff in the quesadilla. My waitress didn't come check on me for a long time so I just sat there making faces. Finally, the manager was checking on the table next to mine, saw my face and asked if everything was alright. I showed him the hard plastic like pieces in the quesadilla and at first he tried to say it was burnt cheese. He leaves to get my waitress after I bang it on the table to show him it's not burnt cheese. The waitress comes over and says \\\"well what do you want us to do?\\\". I tell her I just want my bill so I can leave. The only reason they are getting 2 stars instead of 1 is because when she came back they comped my quesadilla, so I paid for my drink and left and won't be visiting again.\n",

      "Review :  We so wanted to love this place! \\n\\nIt was our only big dinner out on our quick trip to Vegas. I had enjoyed a lunch at Craft in Century City a year ago, and we are big fans of Top Chef. Too bad the quality that Tom C. expects on that show has been left to wither at Craftsteak. \\n\\nIt started with being seated next to a server station. Of course most everyone is since they put it right in the middle of each dining section. The back to the chair in which my dining partner was sitting was broken. It took standing up and physically trying a nearby empty chair to get any attention. \\n\\nIt also took us some time before we realized that we were being served by a \\\"team\\\". Usually roles are clear when there are multiple servers. Here there was no head waiter, just two completely uncoordinated partners. One would ask if we wanted to be walked through the menu. We said, \\\"no thanks.\\\" Then the other waiter swung by and launched into an in depth description without asking. When asked if I wanted to keep the wine list, I said, \\\"yes, thank you.\\\" Then the other waiter came by and took it away without asking. More to the point, one of the two had no idea or ability to articulate what came with the shellfish sampler. It took asking three times to get to the fact that there was lobster, and another few questions to confirm that it was in a salad mixture of some sort. Icing on the cake: the busboy soaked us with his table rag while cleaning the table next to us. Gross. \\n\\nBottom line: this is not service worthy of the reputation or the price tag. \\n\\nThe food was a great big MEH. Here's the quick breakdown:\\n\\nWagyu tartare - delicious, but not the best I've had. Prefer the traditional French bistro/brasserie preparation.\\nFried zucchini blossoms - terrible. Turned one of my favorite sides/apps into piles of greasy, deep fried breading. Blossoms practically unrecognizable. \\nRibeye - very tasty, well cooked, right on the money.\\nStrip - fine, but not remarkable.\\nRisotto w/peas and shrooms - delicious, perfectly al dente and creamy.\\nRamps & morels - ok, but uber salty.\\nSnow peas - delicious! fresh and crispy.\\nAu gratin - mediocre\\n\\nHad a Pinot Noir and a Cab by the glass. Both were overpriced, but good.\\n\\nFirst time I've left 15% gratuity in a long time. And I even backed out the tax before making my calculation. \\n\\nWe'd say that we hoped you'd clean up your act, but it is quite clear that you've sacrificed quality to maximize cashing in on celebrity and notoriety with this clip joint.\n",

Really cool vibe.  Super convenient location to my hotel room (15 stories up).  But it just didn't make the cut.\\n\\nNumber one : why go here when there is a perfectly good bar in the lobby of the Sheraton, offering the same limited bar selections and the same \\\"Bar\\\" menu (only the prices are lower in the lobby).  \\n\\nNumber two : (the loneliest number) if you're missing additional members of your party, you're likely to get lost in the shuffle.

You may choose from a very limited number of appetizers (essentially, the unappetizing ones), but at least cocktails are AROUND $5 (you can find cheaper/better further downtown).  Prices are pretty stiff, the usual for hotel restaurants.  An 8oz \\\"bowl\\\" of soup will run you about $7.  An appetizer of pretzel bites, $14.  Only vegetarian entree of white beans and greens, $22 (what?!).\\n\\nNumber four : the only cider they have tasted like the smell of dirty mops (though, it may have been the glass....which still isn't promising).\\n\\nNumber five : .......the hair that broke the camel's back.  ....O yeah.  Needing something sweet to brighten my bleary evening, I splurged on the Huckleberry Bread Pudding Sundae  (with horchata ice cream, candied pecan *singular*, caramel drizzle, and sweet creep dollop $6).  It was actually pretty good.  It was brightening my blustery blues.....until I saw the very-not-mine hair emerging from the slice of pie.  The cost of this was waved from my tab (as it should have been), but the experience was terribly off-putting.\\n\\nI don't anticipate being in the area any time soon - but I'd encourage Sheraton-stayers to explore beyond the limits of the lobby...\n",

      "Review :  You'll have to forgive me. I live in Los Angeles where there is valet parking for hamburgers and top chefs have food trucks that can be found here, there and everywhere. A burger with a side of fries smothered in Duck Confit with White Truffle Sauce - so perhaps the bar is a tad higher than here in - ack - Pittsburgh where I found myself searching for sustenance before attending the wedding that brought me here. I only hope the godawful mess I actually ate doesn't rear it's ugly head mid-ceremony.\\n\\nIt sounded like such a novel concept, a sandwich with all the sides just piled on. After all, it's all going to the same place, right? Having been born and raised in Chicago it was a familiar concept. The noble Chicago Dog, a study in contradictions: sweet and sour, spicy and mild, hot and cold - a veritable melange that blends and tantalizes from the first bite to the last. Yes! I'll try it!\\n\\nWith my omnivore brother and his lovely wife I made my way through the chilly streets of downtown Pittsburgh on this frosty Saturday. A bustling little metropolis, scant parking so (I am shamed to admit) I pulled in a nearby lot that charged an $8 flt fee. A small price to pay, I reasoned, for a gastronomic delight as has been described here. Yes, as I said, I'm from out of town.\\n\\nOn to the main event - my bro and his bride went with the signature piece, the pastrami sandwich. I opted for the Hot Sausage with cheese. May god have mercy on my gastrointestinal tract.\\n\\nIt is a wonder how a sandwich with so many things can be so uniformly bland. Perhaps it starts with the niggardly portions of actual meat - when confronted with this sandwich in profile it is hard to find under the wad of soggy fries and tasteless cole slaw. The liquid in the slaw makes the bread begin to disintegrate almost immediately so that should you be as foolhardy as I and actually attempt to eat this mess it will be all over the table in short order.\\n\\nI ate it - I admit that. I'm not proud of it, but I was that hungry. The saving grace of the near-complete lack of any discernable seasoning is that I don't have an aftertaste to suffer through, but the leaden ball in the pit of my stomach promises to make up for that with a trip or two to the bathroom in the hopefully not too distant future.\\n\\nI would eat at McDonalds before I went back here.

I booked it several days ahead so that I wouldn't end up sitting in the waiting area for a long time.  When I made it I specified that I would be waiting, they confirmed day before.  I arrived and checked in 1:50pm. At 2:40 I noticed that my car had not even been moved from the place I had parked it. My boyfriend went to ask if they had maybe done it and put it back before we even noticed. They apologized for the wait, and said that it was being done right then, and would be finished in a few minutes. My boyfriend pointed to the car in the lot and asked again if maybe it was finished and they forgot to tell us. Manager- \\\"I don't know what the hell those guys are doing out there.\\\" He went and talked to the guys in the garage and they did start it a few minutes later. He did not charge for it, and gave me a coupon for half off of the next one. So I have to give some credit for that.\\nThe rest of the experience really made up my mind though. First of all, I know it gets busy and a manager needs to be able to trust that his employees will do their job, but this one was not keeping tabs on the employees and they were NOT doing their jobs. They fix people's brakes for a living.The manager is reporting that they have provided service that had not been started.\\nIn the hour I listened to the service managers conversations with the customers that were picking their vehicles up, I heard him tell several customers that he had done more work than they had authorized and charge them up to twice what they had been quoted. It was necessary and required for safety reasons. Same crap has been pulled on me and I know better now.\\nI just don't trust them, to the point where I checked my oil that day to see if it had really been changed. It had been.\n",

Tasty.\\n\\nToday I opted for the drive thru for the first time, and I took a moment to decide whether I wanted to switch it up with some chicken.

I decided to wait until I got home to investigate further.\\n\\nMy burrito was assembled as if it had purposefully been intended to be the worst burrito ever. 2/3 of one end was chicken and the last third was cheese, beans, a few grains of rice, pico, and maybe a DROP OR TWO OF GUAC.

Security was diligent in letting us know the door was open via phone and visits to the room. Except for the night our room at Elara was robbed. Just seems sketchy. Reports were filed, and we were directed by Mr. Hill of the security team to file reports immediately. Security also admitted the locks on the double penthouse doors aren't the greatest and are currently being changed out to better locks. He also provided the address to the closet substation. He sez 'go there now'. I discovered after a hike past Mandalay Bay, the substation is M-F, 9-5. Its Sunday, memorial day weekend. They are flippin closed. Hilton refused to send a car after directing us to the closed substation. According to management, it isn't their responsibility to know the hours of operation for the police department. Understandable, but chaps my behind nonetheless. Hike back to Elara(no money for a cab) to find the fire alarms going off. I am too hot(physically and mentally) to care at this point. At the desk, I work my up the chain of command to Steven Arent, who is kind enough to admit that it has not been a pleasant stay. He was nice, but it was a nice prepared remarks tourist speech that behind it all...it was so faked/forced. However, we learned from Steven that the reports can be filed by phone, no visit to a substation required. The 2 hour walk in the baking sun was a waste. He gave us a 100$ room service credit. To be split by 3 broke people that got our money stolen to split for 2 days. Cheapskate, considering it was a 3500$, paid for upfront penhouse that got robbed.

The atmosphere isn't too bad but it isn't too great either. The only major difference I saw from the former Cadillac Ranch / Ranch House is that the mechanical bull was replaced by a small dance floor. \\n\\nAs mentioned in previous reviews, the staff is obliterated early on in the evening which makes it challenging to get a drink in under 15 minutes (after you place your order). Prepare to repeat your order several times. The DJ stopped the music periodically to insist all bars be filled with girls (both bartenders and patrons) who would then dance on the bar while the bartenders poured free \\\"shots\\\" directly into patrons' mouths. The shots were in an unmarked bottle and were an odd purple color. Avoid the mystery bottle that just grazed the mouths of 30 other people.\\n\\nOverall, I understand the idea of a party bar but this one missed the mark.

I was a little runny, but I think it was because they got my order wrong the first time and rushed to make me another. I might go back and try other things, but it's also a bit over-priced so maybe not. When there are endless choices of breakfast places, I would go back if others were going there. I probably wouldn't suggest it.\n",

Back in as little as 2005 this casino was a great investment for a room and a little walk.  The monorail, also a better deal back then, could get you up into the heart of The Strip easy.  \\n\\nNow it's just a pale imitation of better times in Vegas, and it feels more like Travelodge than say Bill's Gamblin' Hall.

      "Review :  All of the reviews here are so positive! I hate to be the debbie downer, but as the rating of two star means \\\"Meh. I've experienced better\\\", that's where I stand as far as this studio goes. I am not new to yoga, so perhaps I've been spoiled by previous studios. I was new to the valley and the great reviews of Spirit of Yoga led me to give them a try. I should preface by saying that I am more inclined to smaller yoga studios. \\n\\nPros: The place is definitely beautiful, very large studios with great interior design. The location is nice too, overlooking a small body of water with geese and ducks hanging out. They have a lot of classes at a lot times, so it makes it very convient to work some yoga into your schedule. \\n\\nCons: The place is busy, that's for sure. When I came for my first class I bought 5 class package, so I could give it a proper try before committing. The front desk was hectic and I was ignored for quite a few minutes before someone paid me any attention. They spoke to me like I should have known what to/where to go/etc. Anyway, I filled out my paperwork and was directed to the class. The room was large and the class was pretty full by the time it started.\\n\\nThe instructor led the class but stayed at the front of the class the whole time, which is understandable since it's such a large class not everyone can get personalized attention. However, I did notice that the instructors (in more than one class I attended) never corrected anyone on form, even with just voice instruction. I find this quite concerning because people can injure themselves in certain postures if not done properly. There are no mirrors, which is good and bad, in my opinion. Good because you're not distracted by watching others in the mirrors. But, bad since there were no corrections at least one could observe their body in a mirror to see if they're out of alignment. \\n\\nThe next two times I came back for classes the front desk couldn't find my paperwork or proof that I paid for the class. \\n\\nMy overall experience here left me wondering what else was out there.\n",

      "Review :  I was hoping for a good (drunk) time but nothing. I like many others got the Groupon deal of an open bar for $10 from the regularly priced $20. Even if you don't have a Groupon, Blondies advertises the best happy your in Vegas: All you can drink (beer or well drinks) from 3-6pm or 10pm-1am, excluding game days. Blondies is located inside the always busy Miracle Mile in Planet Hollywood. It's a great place to catch a game compared to other pricier places on the Vegas strip.\\n\\nMe and my lady friend went in on Friday, January 17 and we're expecting a wait but it was pretty dead for 10pm on a Friday night. Blondies has some serious square footage and there's a plethora of sports memorabilia and flat-screens littered throughout the bar and grill. We were told to seat ourselves wherever we wanted and we headed towards the back bar. However, we quickly made our way back to the front bar after the bar tender informed us she was closing up.\\n\\nAfter seating ourselves, a server was quick to tend to us and we let him know we had the open bar deal. He went on to put a bracelet on us and began serving us well drinks. Simple vodka and juice drinks. The first drink was nothing to brag about. I felt like I was drinking expired cranberry juice while my girlfriend drank orange juice. I knew then and there we were not going to get drunk. Five drinks (each) later we were exploding from a big dinner and tons of cranberry and orange juice. Not even a buzz. We decided to call it quits and take our loss. \\n\\nI think my biggest gripe is the inconsistency in drinks. The bartenders were great guys but one was making us real drinks while the other was serving us juice. Regardless I was nice enough to tip every time. The TV at our bar was playing an old UFC fight and my lady was forced to watch some guy get his head and nose bashed in while we drank our watered down drinks. We could have asked to change the channel, but didn't feel like bothering our bartenders. I'm sure this isn't a bad place by any means but I'll have to dispute their claim as the best happy hour in Vegas. \\n\\nAmbiance/Decor: 3/5\\nFood (Drinks): 1/5\\nService: 3/5\\nPrice: $$\\nOverall: 2/5\\n\\nPros:\\n+ Full bar\\n+ Open 24 hours\\n+ Drink specials\\n+ Lunch/dinner menu\\n+ Cute hostess' and bartenders\\n\\nCons:\\n- Open bar drinks vary in strength\n",

After a long, hard day at work, I often go by myself for some good food and relaxed atmosphere on the restaurant side of the place.\\n\\nLast night I ordered a gorgonzola burger. My burger came out with a very mild, yellow cheese on it.  I decided to eat it anyway, as I was starving, but mentioned to my server that I had ordered gorgonzola and gotten cheddar.  I declined a different burger, as I'd already started eating and it was fine, just not what I'd ordered.  She came back in a few minutes to tell me that the chef had told her that the cheese *was* gorgonzola, and that cheddar melted brown and gorgonzola melted yellow.  I respectfully disagreed.  \\n\\nWhen my check came, I was charged for a gorgonzola burger.  I asked that the charge for the burger be reduced to the price of a regular cheeseburger (about a dollar).  This prompted a visit by the bartender, but no offer to adjust my bill.  There was also an extra dollar charge on my bill, which was either for gorgonzola cheese or sweet potato fries -- I couldn't figure it out, and no one came back to answer questions.  I paid the bill, but they have lost a long-time, regular customer.\n",

At least they were decent to talk to and understanding about day to day happenings. the new management team in the office now are cunts and have no sense of urgency or how to run a business. Because the rent payment process is for the most part automated, there is no need for them to be there other than to give tours and sign people up.

      "Review :  Okay, here is the only review you need.  I have been going to this buffet for more than a decade, possibly since its inception when the cost was $16.99, and also hold platinum membership at the Rio.  At that time the lobster and crab legs alone made this place for worth the cost. Then the cost went to $19.99, $24.99, 29.99, and $34.99.  All the while the quality increased at least in proportion with the cost. They added clams, an entire sushi bar, and always had high quality, fresh seafood no matter the preparation.  So, I recently visited once again in March 2008 to find that the buffet was under construction. I was disappointed since this is one of the reasons for my travel to the Rio. However I understood it was probably going to be a nice upgrade so anticipated a subsequent visit. I traveled to this RIo, stayed in an upgrade suite, and went to the buffet that night of arrival. Good night! MAJOR DOWNGRADE. Sushi bar cut in half as to selection, and freshness gone. Lobster - absolute disappointment! They were as small as crawdads and my company mentioned that they were in fact crawdads, and NO I did not mix them up with the crawdad section. Crab legs? Smaller than average and dirt and grime all over the shells, like they were just caught out of filthy infested waters. They upgraded the furniture like some sort of modern city joint - not the nice homely place it was. So to sum this up the buffet is worth $24.99 - not a dime more! Poor quality and lower than average. Better food at Todai, or Onami - franchise type seafood buffets. Side note - rooms poor quality, so overall perhaps this was recessionary effect.\n",

When my waiter came by, I asked him as well, and he agreed there was cornstarch. I told him I couldn't eat it, and he did not offer to take it away and replace it. He returned shortly after and said he checked with the chef, and said they were wrong, and there was no cornstarch. I had two bites of it, and decided it didn't seem safe. I ate the vegetables instead. I have spent the rest of my evening in awful pain from reacting to the food. If you are celiac, I don't recommend dining here.\n",

      "Review :  Went here last night (Friday, February 28, 2014) and I will NEVER go back to this place! We were a party of \\\"3\\\", they would not seat us until my friend arrived. I told the very RUDE hostess at the front desk (older woman with glasses and dark hair to her shoulders) that my friend would be here in just 5 minutes, that she just lives right down the road and I was super hungry and wanted to start eating chips & salsa now. She ignored me and spoke with the other hostess. She let me stand there not speaking to me, then repeated herself stating that she would seat us when the rest of my party arrived. Who are you KIDDING? REALLY? There were 30 people coming in behind me on a Friday night and you won't seat me? This was wrong and not very service friendly. I think they need to adjust their policy! I left very angry and will NEVER EVER eat at this restaurant or any of the other Tia Rosa's.\n",

Although the guy who took my order was nice, I had to repeat my order twice and had to correct him when he read it back to me and was missing an item. Of course when I got there it was still wrong. I ordered 3 gyro sandwiches, 1 gyro platter, large order of platos potatoes (seasoned fries)  and some cheesecake. I received only 3 gyros so I was missing one. This was what I kept telling the guy over the phone that I wanted 3 gyros PLUS the platter but he still didn't get it. Oh well he didn't charge me for it and I didn't want to wait longer for them to make it so I just left with what I had.\\n\\nThe gyro was gross the meat was cold, very dry and flavorless. We asked for the cucumber sauce on the side and it came in 1oz cups. Same with the hummus that comes w/ the platter and the sauce that comes with the large order of fries. Reallly 1oz??? It makes me angry to pay 8.00 for a sandwich and get a little cup of sauce. Gyro time is way better for gyros if that's what your looking for do not waste your time here! I did enjoy the aphrodite cheesecake which is why the 1 star but everything else from the food to the service was crappy.\n",

Comparable to a subway, you'll get in the que hoping you had your sandwich ready in minutes. Instead you'll get a number that's called shortly after your order is placed. \\n\\nI ordered the original sandwich, which is basically a suped-up roast beef sandwich comparable to Arby's. The bread was fine, but the quality of meat disappointed me quite a bit. While thick slices covered hastily in horseradish, the tendons absolutely ruined the sandwich. I couldn't chew through my sandwich and found myself spitting it out. The bites I could chew required mustard to make it through.\\n\\nIt may be a result of a very busy establishment and a lack of quality control, but I don't think my experience in Vegas was highlighted by the original sandwich. I won't be coming back here again, and I hope there will be more taste in the roast beef for those who have it in the future.\n",

Walking in was not a pleasant experience.  The decor reminds me of a twelve year old pre-pubescent girl.  Not a good thing.  There are way too many non-cupcake related cheap gifts cluttering the right side of the decent sized bakery.  \\n\\nI ordered a peanut butter chocolate cupcake, my usual, and the husband ordered a chocolate mint cupcake.  My chocolate cake was dry and tasted off.  Other reviewers suggest that this is because they used cake mix, and I have to agree. That's probably it. The frosting however, I liked because it was super sweet and peanut buttery. The grainy texture was a little irritating, but the flavor was still good. Opponents of super sweet will not enjoy these. The husband also had a chocolate cake and the accompanying \\\"off\\\" taste. He also wasn't sure if the mint was in the cake as well as in the frosting. He enjoyed the frosting but remembered the far superior cupcakes we had enjoyed at Yummy Cupcakes in California previously.\\n\\nI may go back here.  It's hard to resist a cupcake when you don't have to make it yourself.  Maybe they were having a bad day when I went.  I am willing to give them a second try.  Cake Cafe, please don't let me down.\n",

We were moved because my 10 yr old daughter was with us and thus, could not sit in the bar area.  Fine...whatever.   Not a big deal.  It was done quickly and smoothly.   The server was courteous,  but not really good at his job.  It took a while to take our orders,  and bring drinks.  Maybe the mostly empty bar was slowing down his service.   After finally deciding to take our orders (Yes we had out menus down for quite some time) food arrived.   Not all at once.  Again,  maybe the kitchen's fault.  However we were starving after having been at the races all day.  Many items were forgotten.   The food was really good though. My steak was a perfect medium, others were on the rare/bloody side, which was not how it was ordered.  But we Wolfed it down anyway.  Not great, but we didn't get sick either...\n",

For around $13 (brucn) at IP, I didn't expect much but cafeteria food and it delivered (good omelet).  But for $25 at Lago Buffet, I would at least expect  SOMETHING a little, just a little, more.  But I got NOTHING, absolutely NOTHING!  \\n\\nThere were very few selections/varieties.  Italian station only offered 4 different pasta and looked like canned food.  The carving station offered Turkey and Prime Rib.  The Prime Rib was not prime at all.  My fiance asked for the end cut.  It was so tough that he couldn't cut it with a regular knife.  And guess what, the server said they didn't have any steak knife!  The only thing somewhat edible was the Roast Chicken.  \\n\\nThe salad station was pretty pathetic, no hard boiled eggs, beans, mushroom, or celery.  What the heck?  This is a buffet, the least you could do is offer a descent salad bar!  \\n\\nThere were 3 kind of sushi rolls, none I would even dare to touch.

My friend arrived and placed his drink order, his beer took a while to get to table, we both ordered on separate bills, he ordered a 1/4 sandwich and I ordered a half sandwich, His sandwich came 10 minutes before mine, but they brought him a half instead of a quarter, She apologized and said she would only charge him for the 1/4 sandwich.  My order came the food was good but she never brought my side of hot peppers, I also did not get a refill on my tea.  When it was time to get the bill, she told my friend if he took the other part of his sandwich home with him the manager said he would have to be charged for it.

The experience was much better, to start.  But, then, we found that the prescriptions of my wife's glasses and my contacts were not correct.  It seems quite unlikely that it was due to changes in our eyes.  The prescription for my wife's glasses was too strong, not too weak, and her eyes did not improve during the past year.  She has new glasses now and her vision is much, much better. \\n\\nIn my case, with the correct prescription for my contacts, I no longer need reading glasses for most things, and again, the prescription is not as strong as before.\\n\\nWe are very happy with the new provider and feel we were just a customer to get in and out for this provider.\n",

      "Review :  You guys. I hate giving bad reviews, I really do. My mom always said that if I can't say something nice, I shouldn't say anything at all. But that's not really the point of Yelp, now is it?\\n\\nHere's the sitch. I had a very small wedding in May, and I heard amazing things about White House, so I decided to go there for my personal flowers for the wedding party. This included bouquets for the ladies and boutonnieres for all the bros. \\n\\nAt my consultation with White House, I brought photos of the succulent bouquets I had in mind, and asked them to recreate the bouquets in the photo. I was VERY clear that they should use the same flowers--even going as far as to provide the name of the succulents I wanted--and the same color palette as featured in the photo. I asked several times if they felt they could do that, and I was assured that they definitely could. I left our meeting feeling completely confident that my expectations would be met. \\n\\nFast forward to my wedding day. White House dropped off my personal flowers, and for a moment, I thought there had been a mix-up. Surely they accidentally dropped off the wrong bouquet. The succulents were not the kind I had asked for (by specific plant name) and the colors were totally wrong. Instead of having a bouquet made of chicks and hens in soft minty greens and light lavenders, highlighted by soft peach roses, I received a horrific bouquet that looked like it would have fit right in at a clown's wedding. There was bright purple. There was a weird color green flower that did not complement the ugly bright purple. There were red roses. Let me repeat: red roses. \\n\\nAnd, since they dropped off the flowers with the front desk of the hotel only five minutes before we were scheduled for photos, instead of dropping them off with me in my suite, I had no one to voice my concerns to. On my wedding day, I had to do the best I could to fix my bouquet, and that is something no bride should have to deal with. \\n\\nNow, every time I look at photos from my wedding day, I am reminded of the TERRIBLE job White House did. I'm just glad I didn't have them handle my centerpieces. This place is a disaster. \\n\\nOh, it would be unfair if i didn't mention that they did a fine job on the boutonnieres. Those looked exactly like the boutonnieres in the photo I provided.\n",

It was the strangest massage I have ever had. I know that everyone has their own techniques, but he only used his elbows the whole time - just bizarre. My boyfriend's massage was good, but he was VERY sore the next few days which is not always normal. I only paid $39 for the groupon but definitely was not even worth that.

I have eaten here over a dozen times. I agree with previous reviews that it is overpriced, but I have let that go as it is locally owned and fresh produce can add up. \\n\\nHOWEVER, twice a single staff member has spilled on me when cleaning up. The first time she spilled salad dressing on my lap and did not seem to realize it. She gave me a strange look when I asked for another napkin. Once she realized it she did apologize. The second time she spilled someone else's ice on my feet and purse. I got a muttered apology with no eye contact. I waited a few minutes to see if someone would do something to try to keep my business. I am a  regular and it was the second spill. No one approached me so I left. \\n\\nI do believe that the young woman is a nice person. She seemed embarrassed, but the staff have poor customer service skills.\\n\\nAlso, I believe that they substitute greens without informing the customer.

      "Review :  The absolute worst hotel experience I've had in my life! Really there is so much to complain about I could write a book. Where to begin? Well, checking in at 11pm on Thursday night was going to take 3-4 hours, so I didn't even get to see my room until 4:30 in the morning. I refused to just stand in the humungous line of over 300 people, so instead I went sight seeing with friends who were staying at a normal hotel across the street. Guess this is what I get for being cheap! Although the rooms were really inexpensive, I would have paid to leave this place. \\n\\nMy other big complaint was their parking garage. It is a giant nonsensical mess of pillars, with no signs directing which way to go. Cars weave every which way, some going the wrong way and almost causing head on collisions. It took me almost half an hour just to cross Las Vegas Blvd to get to the garage portion. Then I had to follow a huge maze, dodging pillars and pedestrians, before finally finding parking. \\n\\nOnce I FINALLY got to my room at 4am, I found that it was decent. It was up on a higher level with a partial strip view, and I think the carpeting was new. The bed was very comfortable, and the room had a small balcony. They upgraded me to this \\\"VIP\\\" room after losing my original reservation. Thank god, because if this was for VIPs, I can't even imagine what a regular room would've looked like! It was very basic, but at least clean. That's more than I can say for the rest of this casino. \\n\\nAt the lobby, gift shop areas, and check in desk, the carpeting was absolutely filthy. The entire property stunk of rancid cigarette smoke, as did the clientele. Everyone walking around in the place looked like bums or out of work hookers.

As soon as I walked in, I noticed the pictures of all the celebrities, mostly hockey players, who visited over the years.  So I thought to myself, this place must be as good as advertised.  \\n\\nI ordered the Whole Hawg, which is a full rack of ribs.  All I can say is these are the worst ribs I have ever eaten.  What the hell is that diarrhea they glazed the ribs with?  I'll tell you what it was.  It was a low quality soy or teriyaki sauce mixed with honey.  The whole thing was a dark and sticky mess that tasted like really bad Chinese or Japanese food served at a cafeteria.  And if that wasn't bad enough, the meat was greasy.\\n\\nEverything is cooked on a gas-fired rotisserie, so I wouldn't really call this BBQ.  At least not the American standard for BBQ.  But if this is Canada's idea of BBQ, they can keep it.\\n\\nThe poulet was only a little better than the ribs, but not by much.  With such lousy food, I can't believe this place has been around for so long.\n",

We reported the problem to the front desk and she offered a similar room on the bottom floor sans funky smell but it wasn't the same. Then she offered to have maintenance come up and \\\"spray\\\" the room.  This is the comment that prompted 2 stars.

With people like James in the Lobby and Tom in the Wellness Center, why skimp on the training for the front desk on Monday night?

Perhaps it was because I was the only sober person on Carson Street at 1 am on Halloween but I have never been angrier at a bar ever. To start the doorman was an ass. I can't blame him all that much because I would be pissed too with the amount of \\\"21\\\" year old asshats coming through the doors but at least TRY to maintain some professionalism. Same with the bartenders. Ok I get it you are busy. But you are going to make a grand tonight so suck it up cupcake. Also use you head. Don't spend so much time on the drunk sluts who order 10 drinks one at a time and don't tip. My biggest complaint however was the clientele. So many assholes that for the first time I honestly hoped a place would spontaneously combust with everyone inside just for the good of humanity. I wish I could say that this was unusual but this seems to be the same story song and dance every weekend at Mario's. \\n\\nYou may ask why this review is getting a 2 star. I must grudgingly say that Mario's does have some redeeming qualities, just earlier in the day. The decor is almost \\\"Cheers\\\"-like. Lots of wood and stained glass. The service, when the bar is about empty, has always been at least pleasant. The food is ok too. Nothing great; standard greasy bar food. \\n\\nAll in all this place is a passable bar prior to about 10 pm.

My few complaints are the way I was treated when I went to a craps table here. I was sitting at a slot machine enjoying a beer when I heard a lot of cheering going on at a craps table so I decided to go check it out and maybe jump in the game.. When I go over there and start watching the pit boss asked this \\\"high roller\\\" I guess if he was going to Make a bet and the exact words that came from this guys mouth was \\\"yeah I will make my bet when you get this as*hole outta here\\\" (he was talking to me but I didn't even know at first) then the pit boss asks me to leave and says its a \\\"private\\\" game... \\n\\n1. There were no stantions blocking it off\\n2.No one said anything besides this douche who was dressed like a slob\\n3. All because you have money doesn't mean you talk to people like that especially a paying guest\\n\\nThe pit boss then Denies he called me a \\\"as*hole when everyone clearly heard him!\\n\\nI'm basically told the guy (the shaggy dude) if he wanted to find out who a real ahole was we can go outside and he just stood there ...\\n\\nThat's my MAIN complaint.. They did nothing to fix the situation you don't let people be treated that way who are paying over 1000 dollars to stay there...\\n\\n\\nOverall the hotel charges WAY too much for EVERYTHING like come on 19.65 for two coronas at the bar? What are they smoking ... I refused to pay that..\\n\\nThe room itself was really nice .. 21st floor strip view.. Can't complain..\\n\\nOverall my opinion save your money and go somewhere with LESS RESORT FEES... These hotels are getting insane..\n",

When we first got here, it was probably about 1145 or so, and the line was pretty long. They only have one cashier who takes your order, and that  coupled with the long line made even getting my order in take pretty darn long. The food itself? I had the baby back ribs and mac salad and potato salad. My thoughts? Meh. The salads were just mediocre and the ribs only a step above the kind you can buy in the package at costco and heat up. Dissappointing to spend $22 and get that, and the servings of the salads were also fairly small. The worst part though? The flies in the dining area. I was constantly having to waive away flies! Unacceptable! I mean maybe it was because of it being the rush hour with people constantly opening the doors but man, it wasnt like I was eating outside, I was eating INSIDE. So in summary, the food was just average, the portions of the sides small, the cost high, and the dining experience, terrible. I  would give it 0 stars if I could. Hopefully they will get these issues addressed.  Not sure how this place can average 4.5 stars,. My visit was just awful.\n",

The servers are very nice and attentive. Gave them a good tip! Food... Half star! Selection was not very good, I guess because they are only open for like a few a hours they only cook one time and that's it! Food is very dry, over cooked and very few selection. The only dessert are jello (my daughter made a comment that it's like a square gummy!) have a few fruits, a pudding, no cakes or cookies. They have that soft serve ice cream. I'm pretty sure this buffet will close in just a few weeks. We left like 1pm and they couldn't even fill up half the place. They are not open for dinner. That's why they charge so much it's not for the food but to pay for their rent. My suggestion go to Krazy Buffet (By Sahara and Cimarron) or Buffet@Asia (they have a couple of branches but the best one was at Spring Mountain and Sahara. You won't even have to pay $10 for lunch and the food is way better than over here (10x way better!) Save your money and just eat at Panda Express, you'll be very pleased! Never coming back here.

      "Review :  What a pile.\\n\\nI will admit to not being an \\\"artiste\\\" and maybe being too pragmatic to \\\"understand\\\" what I saw when I went here about a month back, but sorry; like other reviewers, I am suspicious as what passes as \\\"art\\\" in a contemporary sense.\\n\\nWhen I went, only a few small rooms were accessible (and from other reviewers' musings, this seems to usually be the case). The biggest of the rooms had two thin wood walls erected in the center. The \\\"art\\\" inside these walls consisted of a bunch of TV screens which would show a picture, then say what the picture was i.e. a picture of a dog, then say in white letters on a black screen \\\"dog.\\\" Somebody got paid to exhibit that? The other exhibit in that piece was hands-on, where you could write an answer to a posited question, i.e. \\\"What would you miss most if you left this planet?\\\" Kind of nice they let you participate, but also kind of like something you'd see at some workshop for kids or something.\\n\\nAnyway, I didn't feel too unsophisticated when my wife, an arty-farty type, also disapproved of this place. With all the sponsors and this-and-that they proudly display on some fancy plaque in the middle of one of the rooms, you'd think they could come up with better (or at least more) of this so-called \\\"art.\\\"\\n\\nI will say the red room with everything made out of pallets was neat. Still, not worth it unless you're getting in for free with a culture pass.\n",

The studio here is so poorly ventilated and the class was so overcrowded that I felt like I was suffocating from all the CO2 in the air.

      "Review :  This placement doesn't even deserve a star so I guess one will do. The only good thing about this restaurant was the hostess, after that everything else went downhill. My server was very untidy and she took forever to get my food. She looked like she had just finished her day shift at a pizza shop and forgot to change her dirty apron which was caked with white dust. Brought me a meal different from what I ordered and didn't have the guts to apologize for it. The food came on a skillet which was supposed to be sizzling but it was cold. Very unappetizing with overlooked onions and a very tiny piece of meat. Place wasn't that busy so I fail to understand why it took over 30 min to get my food. And it looked like a dog had passed on the food then it was brought to me. When she asked me how the food was, I told her that it wasn't what I ordered and she just rolled her eyes. I was tired and didn't want to start fussing with her so I just paid and left. But one thing I can commend about the restaurant is the fact that when I requested for my check, it came in less than 30 seconds. This is the worst Applebee's experience I've ever had in my life and I don't think I ever want to go to an Applebee's if this is the kind of service I get. Over to you Mr. Applebee's CEO.\n",

The hostess was very nice and asked if we were seeing a movie so she could inform the server of our schedule. The waiter was very nice and made suggestions on both the drink and dinner menu. The menu's all looked interesting and we were looking forward to the food. Unfortunately that's where it went down hill. Muscles appetizer was very disappointing and the waiter and Managment agreed it was unacceptable and brought out another one at no charge. The muscles were extremely small and in the first order one third of the order had closed shells. While we waited for our dinner selection a server came to our table to prepare an appetizer that we did not order, wrong table. Our entree came to the table 5 minutes before the movie was to begin so we asked for it to be served in the theatre. The GM brought the plate to us and unfortunately the stuffed shrimp was cold. While we waited for the dinner in the theatre the server took our drink order and during the move brought my wife her drink and never returned with mine. She didn't come back until it was time for the check. To top it off while we waited for our car the group next to us was talking about their experience and how three of the four dinners came out wrong. The Managment was very concerned and attentive but for the prices we paid for a movie and dinner this did not come close to my expectations nor did it for the people standing next to us waiting for our cars.\n",

      "Review :  This review is for the convention / meeting room facilities. And I am NOT IMPRESSED. In many other cities the Rio's convention and meeting room facilities would be considered downright opulent and something a city would be proud to have for hosting events. In Vegas, it's like yawn, been there, done that, it's a little dated and not all that. \\n\\nService: Hustle was the word of the day for our visit from the manager we directly worked with. Got service with a smile too. When a technical difficulty came up their IT staff was on the ball with a quick response. I always love that and give it mad praise when you get that kind of service. \\n\\nFood: The food was average. Pretty to look at, slow to get on the table, servers didn't pay attention and were sloppy in getting food on and off the tables and it is insulting to tea to lump their so called offering into the category of tea. Bleech. \\n\\nBut that's where the positive comments come to a halt. Seriously if you're paying premium money to rent a room for an event and they roll out a cheap projector that is broken to the point they put a 9 volt battery under one corner of it so it would project a level image onto the screen? Seriously? Of all the comps I've ever received in Vegas, a 9 volt battery to fix junk equipment is the worst on the list. (See the picture, you can't make this stuff up.)\\n\\nIf you forget a clicker for your Powerpoint, it's a cool $125 a day rental for something I could have bought for half price had I had the time to grab a cab and run to Fry's to buy one (including the cab fare and cabbie tip). I ended up making changes so it wasn't needed but the price they quoted takes \\\"FLEECING\\\" to a whole other level. \\n\\nWhen I compare the Gold Coast to the Rio in terms of price vs. square footage, quality of the space, quality of the A/V equipment, and yes even the staff, the Gold Coast quite frankly kicks the Rio's ass HARD. Anyone renting space for a meeting and considering the Rio needs to think long and hard about it as most likely they are not receiving the best value for their money. \\n\\n2 Stars, and even the second star is one I'm on the fence about giving. But a placement on my Jackassery list is a must. As yes, I think sticking a braying jackass in place of the Rio's management team would do a better job of handling this place. (Again our one on site rep who I can't name was awesome considering she was working with crappy equipment). Oh and the extra valet we paid for...can someone give those guys some 5 hour energy before letting them loose to retrieve cars? Yeah, not happy. We deserve better. And we'll be getting better.\n",

      "Review :  I saw this place had a Groupon so I hopped on Yelp to look at the reviews.  Since they were positive I decided to buy it because the reviewers made me really excited about this place.  What a bust!  I will say that whenever I am excited about a restaurant and I see low reviews, I generally think those people are babies.  It's them that I should have listened too.  And here goes one of the whiners...\\n\\nThe area of town and the outside of the restaurant prompted my wife to comment that she 'felt like she was in another city'.  I thought to myself 'exactly the reason this place is going to be so great'.  Inside was the same story.  The decor was so odd and unflattering that I thought again to myself,'this place is going to be great'!  The sauce all over my menu just sealed it for me.  Greatness!  What I'm trying to say is that if you have 20 or so reviews and you still have 4 stars then I will overlook all of this garbage because you MUST have great food.\\n\\nAfter three different people took different orders from us we ended up with our house salad.  Greatest salad ever?  Nope.  The salad had to be from a bag and it was covered (COVERED!) in ranch dressing.  To top it off there was about an inch of water covering the bottom of the bowl.  (I made sure to post a pic of it.)  Gross.  We couldn't even eat it and I was starving!  When they took the salad bowls away they asked why we hadn't eaten it...oh wait, I was dreaming.  They didn't even acknowledge the fact that the salad was untouched.  Then the food came out and I was staring at some round piece of food that was supposed to be a Chile Relleno (Picture).  I have had a number of Chile Rellenos in my day and none of them have ever been round.  I will spare you all the drama to say it was the worst Chile Relleno I've ever eaten.  The sauce was so odd that I couldn't even gag it down.  My wife's enchiladas were also pretty bland/bad.  \\n\\nI truly cannot even believe this place has 4 stars.

The chef recommends medium rare, so this is how I ordered it. It came more than well done. When asked, I did show the waiter (and later the manager) the meat, they saw it was obviously over done. Of course they apologized and offered to re-fire...it was then that I told them of our 1 1/2 hour time limit, and I didn't want to get kicked off of the table!!! \\n\\nMore apologies, they were very sorry...the manager said she had no idea how the time limit thing happened...but would definitely address the situation.\\n\\nDessert was ordered, coffee and donuts. This was a little cup of coffee pudding and 3 beignets...Again, I'm puzzled why a dessert ordered for 2 people had 3 beignets, instead of 2, or 4, which would have made much more sense. But, they were delicious.\\n\\nThe price was above average for Charlotte, and most meals and restaurants in this price range do a much better job.\\n\\nOverall, the quail was spectacular, other things mediocre, and the lamb just awful.

It was early saturday night and we wanted something to eat before we went out. All I wanted was a deli style sandwhich (which is pretty hard to find). I called the concierge and she mentioned this place. I looked it up online through my phone and said \\\"why not.\\\"\\n\\nI walked down to the place and it was packed! There was a line waiting but I walked right in to the \\\"take-out\\\" window. I ordered a roast beef sandwich with a side of clam chowder.

Damn how I wish I would have gotten a crepe with them.\\n\\nI opened my soup container and it literally looked like someone put half water, half olive oil, a tablespoon of alfredo sauce, soggy microscopic pieces of celery, and potato. I don't even remember if there were CLAMS in my CLAM chowder, that's how terrible this thing was! I didn't even know that clam chowder came minestrone style! But apparently here at the Red, White, & Blue, IT DOES!\\n\\nI chocked down my soup and happily went on to the sandwich. I opened it and the thing looked AMAZING! Exactly what you would expect a roast beef sandwich to look like - the meat looked fresh, the tomatoes were vibrant, and the lettuce was beautiful. I took a bite into it and all I tasted was dry bread and a TERRIBLE wasabi mayonnaise. \\n\\nBLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHHH!!!\\nWhat the h*ll did I get to eat?!?!\\n\\nFirst off, how many people like the taste of wasabi on their sushi, much less on a ROAST BEEF SANDWICH?! Why couldn't you have given me NORMAL mayonnaise instead of this crap?!\\n\\nSo, once again, I literally had to CHOKE down half of the sandwich and then I called it a day. I didn't even attempt to eat their nasty looking chips that came with it. To this DAY those chips are still sitting in my pink Vegas Pimp Cup.\\n\\nDO NOT GO HERE unless you want to feel even more cheated out of your money than you already are in Vegas!!!!\\n\\nOn a side note - LOVED staying at TheHotel's suite at Mandalay Bay!\n",

That's a pet peeve of mine that chefs think they have perfectly seasoned the food for every palate.\\n\\nThe lamb was done well, didn't see any eggplant on the plate unless it was the pear-tasting item on the plate.

Just as an example, our server brought our ticket to the table. 15 minutes later, she ambled by to pick up the ticket with our credit card. 10 minutes later, she finally brought it back for me to sign. This was after an hour-and-a-half dining experience which should have taken half the time but due to our waitress' slowness and lack of attention, was stretched into painful wait times. Never received a refill on my soda.

When we told him we were looking to buy my nephew his first knife for scouts, he proceeded to bad mouth the scouts in front of my nephew, calling them \\\"pussies.\\\"  ...classy... When i asked to look at some drop point knives, my brother (who isn't all that knife savvy) asked the guy what that meant.  He then told my brother that it meant the blade was shaped like a spear.  ... The guy works in a knife shop and doesn't know the difference between a drop point and a spear point???  The whole experience was pretty much like that.  We'd ask a question and Mr. Crackhead counter boy would give us an incorrect answer as rudely as he possibly could.\\n\\nI will concede that they do have a decent selection of knives, including benchmade, al mar and spyderco.

My dad's whole family worked at a Chinese restaurant in Philly from before I was born until the late 1990's.  My mother says she craved Chinese food the whole time she was pregnant with me and by proxy got me hooked on Chinese in the womb. I bless her for having done so. I love Chinese and could eat it every day...willingly.  I've tried Chinese in every city and country I've ever lived or visited, as I always love to see what's out there and experience the regional variances and interpretations. I can usually find something good, no matter how nasty or base a buffet, or made-to-order.  And Lord knows I love take-out and a movie on the sofa.  Great nite, rite?\\n\\nA few weeks ago I convinced the better half to go pick up Gourmet House of Hong Kong, if I paid and he drove. Deal. Done.  I ordered on the phone - no problems. It's rite down the street from our house, so dinner was steaming hot and in the living room within 20 minutes.  We queued up the DVD and we're ready to go.\\n\\nThe fried rice was yummy and OK.  Not the best I've had but not the worst either.  The BBQ pork app was good and I liked the dipping sauce it came with. Everything else was skank.  I'd say avoid the noodles at all costs. They were like nasty over-cooked spaghetti in a watery, flavorless sauce.  Even with soy sauce added, they did nothing for me.  \\n\\nI'm kind of sad b/c the other reviews on Yelp seemed pretty good.  The place is not that great looking from the outside, and never having been inside, I can't comment on that -- but I would never get take-out from here again.  At least we didn't get sick.  It was just bland-o-rama, which makes me sad.

      "Review :  No me gusta. No me gusta at all.\\n\\nThis should be my favorite place in Las Vegas: Artisan Burgers and amazing beer both local and foreign. Even the service was grand. What went horribly wrong? There are two factors that make this place a definitive nope: one is the price of everything is out of touch with reality. Sure this is in the Mandalay Bay on the strip, but it's actually in one of those weird connector mini-malls we have so many of. This is a very nice retail passageway, but it's not actually Mandalay Bay proper. Even if it were I am sure I could find a greater value in food virtually anywhere else in the Mandy.\\n\\nThe problem isn't just the prices, which are certainly atrocious, it's just that the burgers aren't good. I had the Hubert Keller signature burger. It wasn't great. The meat wasn't particularly flavorful,  the red wine and shallots sauce was vinegary and the side of the chipolte aioli was bland and seemed old. The Buffalo was dry the previous time I came here and I chalked it up to being the nature of the meat. It's not, I've had spectacular buffalo since and much better value.\\n\\nThe beer list is utter torture. It's glorious in it's depth and yet should anyone actually pay those prices they should immediately be carved into servings and fed to starving African Children. A handy strip mark-up is one thing, within reason. But charging eight times retail for a beer readily available at local gas stations almost almost makes me want to go all Reductio ad Hitlerum up in this review. I scoured the beer menu and could not find a purchase I was willing to make. I cannot remember the last time I went to a restaurant such as this and just had a soda. I actually did not purchase a beer.\\n\\nIf you can afford this place go to a burger restaurant that actually has decent food. Better yet check out \\u00e9 by jos\\u00e9 andr\\u00e9s and save a few bucks.\n",

      "Review :  This is probably the second to last dermatologist on your list of doctors to see. This is a long delayed review, but I had out my experiences in the back of my mind until we met a strange character, Dr. Saul from AD at a Yelp event earlier this month.\\n\\nThe last time I saw Dr. Schreiber was over a year ago when I went to him for a reoccurring rash I had on my stomach (which would spread to other parts of my body). I sat waited in the office for 30-40 minutes with an appointment made the week prior, then waited for the doctor for about 20 minutes as I dressed into the paper coverings I was left. Dr. Schreiber came in, told me that the rash was due to metal contact from the button in jeans with my skin and wrote me a script for medication used to treat scabies and psoriasis without any real direction other than to apply the cream and lotion twice daily. I filled the prescriptions, and the medication was messy so application wasn't really clean cut. The medication didn't work, but I was too turned off by my first experience to come back to this office. \\n\\nAfter some research, I was able to come up with my own prediction- I may have been intolerant of an iron supplement added to a medication I was taking. I had the prescription changed and like magic, the rash cleared up completely within a few months. I would have preferred had he offered an allergy test or biopsy of some sort to conclude a diagnosis, but I guess he didn't have the time. \\n\\nI would compare a visit to this office to a visit to your local UMC Quick Care. There's very little compassion from the front desk for their long wait times, and the doctor makes a quick diagnosis with no follow-up what-so-ever. Maybe in some cases, his diagnosis is correct and his treatment works. In my case, it did not but thankfully I am now able to manage my skin condition.\n",

This was how I learned we were the black sheep of the family, because there is no way I would tell even my worst enemy to ever step foot in this place.\\nEvery casino/hotel in Vegas has a smoky atmosphere, but in this place you can feel the gritty cigarette smoke that hangs in the unfiltered air. The front desk staff are apathetic if not necessarily rude. You have to give your room key to security before you can get into the elevator, not because they are so up-scale as to offer added security but because only psychopaths and desperate people come here, and desperate people will probably try to break into your room at some point to steal whatever they can get their hands on.\\nThe beds were uncomfortable but the rooms were clean at least. My requested wake-up call came through, even though when I called at 2 a.m. to request a 6 a.m. wake-up call the operator laughed at me like I was insane, which I was not to pack up and leave the moment our taxi first pulled up to this hell-hole.\\nA word on the food, which everyone points to as the reason to ever come here: the buffet is horrendous, don't do it. The cafe has a great burger and fries special with your player's club card (you don't actually have to play, the card is free) for about 2 dollars; at 3 in the morning you can take all your siblings and their kids to the cafe for the 3.99 ham and eggs (one players card for every 4 people will ensure everyone gets this rockin' deal) and no one will leave hungry, though the potatoes were cold once and the ham is salty. Still, I think I'd rather have paid a lot more for food and stayed someplace where I wasn't worried about what I would catch walking down the hall to my room.\\nAll in all, I will never forgive my family for suggesting this place, and I actually may never go back to Vegas, because all the glitz and glamour in the world will not be able to erase the traumatic memories I have of that city now. Thanks a lot, Arizona Charlie's. \\nOh, but if I do go back, I will take full advantage of the free drinks cocktail waitresses bring you when you are sitting at a machine, not even playing but just waiting for the rest of your party to come down so you can leave.

      "Review :  They weren't friendly and almost everything I tried to order had some rule that prevented me from getting the quantity I preferred. Every meat seemed to be styled from a different city (Kansas City brisket, Memphis pulled pork, St.louis ribs, etc.) so the place really didn't have it's own identity. The sides looked good but really lacked flavor. For example, the potato salad looked fabulous but really didn't taste like anything; the macaroni and cheese tasted like butter I guess. The biggest problem was the way they presented the meat. I ordered a three meat plate and they poured sauce on everything (NOT a good sign) and basically scrunched all three meats into a bowl. The brisket was thin and chewy, basically no smoked flavor. It also had cracks in it, so I guess they don't cut to order (either that are they are really doing something wrong). The ribs looked promising, but again they were chewy and no smoked flavor. The pork had slightly more flavor and the texture seemed right but the sauce was inappropriate (pulled pork typically has a thin vinegar sauce on the side, not BBQ sauce on top). Honestly, I didn't finish it and as much as I hate to waste food I threw at least half of it away.\n",

We asked the front desk what door hotel guest had to go to and they sent us to do door that was not letting anyone in the pool.

I asked for the manager and when the pool manager came over, I told him I wanted to speak with the hotel manager and he told me he couldn't call her. I had to get up, walk all the way across the casino again and wait about 30min to speak with her. She did give us $200 towards our cabana, but we still paid $300. I couldn't believe it.

And, the famed beignets were frankly nothing so special that I'd go there just for them. \\n\\nOur main issue has to do with the fact that one of the people in our party had a dairy allergy and we alerted them to this when we made the reservation and again when we were seated and even saw a sign saying they were happy to handle dietary restrictions/allergies when we walked in the door. We were repeatedly assured it would be no problem as everything is made to-order, but it was a problem and a disappointment as the great majority of  things (even on the regular menu) were not feasible and desserts were impossible (save for a mid-winter fruit plate in WI which is never a good thing).

I shared my feelings with the manager who was absolutely amazing; thanks for the great service recovery. The massage therapist was 5 minutes late and did not apologize. I asked 1 of the attendents for the time and she said to me, \\\"look on the wall, there is the clock...\\\" I was taken back by the rudeness and she corrected herself after I told her that I would not ask if I saw a clock....the therapist rushed through the massage, did not gracioulsy place my hands the table but instead let them flop down, she did not place the towel on my back but \\\"dropped it\\\" which was alarming. I did not leave her my usual twenty % tip but gave 10% instead becuase the massage was somwhat average but combined with her NOT being attentive to details and making the environment calm, relaxing, welcoming...instead she was breathing hard, rushing, making me feel uncomfortable and actually started cleaning the room after less than 1 min when I placed on my robe and was still in the room. I HAVE NEVER EVER had a therapist clean the room while I was still standing in the room to get myself together; big NO NO for all therapists. If you are rushing but I was on time then its not my fault. She could have acknowledged. I then shared with her why I gave her a lesser tip and all she could say was that, \\\"she had an off day...and all her clients compliment her for the flow...\\\" This was a bit defensive and I did not appreciate it. Again, the experience and amenities were awesome but it was not worth paying $215 for a massage that was really 60 mintues and 15 was talking...Not fair. The manager was so sweet and kind so I really enjoyed the rest of my afternoon. She was customer service friendly and knew how to recover the client.

The most memorable thing I can think of when I think of Shanghai is that everyone seems to get a job doing PR for this club at some point in their university life. \\n\\nI think there is far more exciting, nicer clubs to visit on George Street so I wouldn't hurry down here.\n",

      "Review :  I don't do Vegas nearly as much as I used to but I wanted to try downtown and the Freemont Street Experience as we were passing through on Thanksgiving weekend. We spent Saturday night here The Plaza was recently remodeled. I was not impressed.\\nThe quality of the remodel, though adequate could have been a lot nicer. The room was clean but the bathroom had a lot to be desired. Since they remodeled the showers they should have raised the shower heads. I'm very tall and the best I could get was mid chest. It would work fine for someone 5'6\\\" or less. The mirror works well for someone 5'9\\\" or less, any taller and you have to squat. Getting from the self parking garage into the casino was interesting. The elevator was very slow, it had carpeting but it was impossible to tell what color it was because of the filth. Like most of  the downtown hotels the cigarette smoke is really bad. Ventilation is much better on The Strip.  On the plus side check in went well and I called housekeeping for an extra pillow and it was there in under 5 minutes.\\n\\n The Freemont St. Experience. Vegas is not a place for kids but we had two with us and it wasn't a good influence. Sure there were costumed characters including Sponge Bob, Mickey and Mini Mouse right in between the almost naked show girls, the guy dressed (undressed) as an Indian in a loin cloth and the diamond vision type screens outside of the strip bars. The bums were a little distressing also.This is Vegas and I am not complaining , I'm only warning other parents that this is really not a place for young-uns. \\n\\nThe next trip will definitely be on the strip sans kids.\n",

I was very clear in my needs and what I wanted (1 bed, no pets, etc etc), and she sounded like she was reading a script the entire time. Telling me about the amenities and the wonderful parking and blah blah blah, I finally had to ask her just to give me the prices. I said I wanted a short term lease, under a specific budget, and needed to move in by a specific date. Continuing with reading off a sheet of paper she starts listing all the 1 bedrooms they have that are out of my price range, exceeding the date I need, and not even considering the short term lease I asked for. When I finally said \\\"It sounds like there's nothing there that fits what I need, thank you\\\" she hung up on me! If this is how they treat prospective tenants... yikes.\n",

Obviously, their private parties make more money than single table, but then DON'T BOOK THE RESERVATION.

The waitress was dressed very provocatively (large breasts falling out of the top of her dress- showing her panties each time she bent over- which was often)- it appeared that many ladies on dates felt uncomfortable, arms crossed immediately with the men looking at the ground... Probably more uncomfortable for the guys really- because one wrong glance or blink and that date is over! \\n\\nIf this is the vibe Merc Bar is going for then... well done I guess.  I will say, it is awkward when a girls large boobs are coming out of her top and she keeps bending down with her chest in your date's face... kudos to her for being an attractive young lady, but it's a bit much when it makes the guests uncomfortable. \\n\\nAlso,  as one woman left her table to use the restroom, I watched the waitress flirt and stroke her husband's arm up and down as she gave him the check... I have a feeling if the wife saw that.... well, I'm happy she didn't, because you just don't know how people are gonna react to that disrespectful, intrusive behavior. It knocked the place down a couple notches- not quite Hooters vibe or strip club lounge- Maybe Champagne room? I really did wonder if I got up to use the restroom, would this girl come over to feel my guy up too? I didn't like that one bit. It wasn't a good feeling to have out with your significant other- and unfortunately, this is the memory I so strongly took away. Then again, it was also interesting watching the guy that somehow ended up on a date with a transexual squirm in the corner as she insisted on playing with his hair and trying to kiss on his neck... That must have been an internet date, lol!\\n\\nAlso, regarding the service, each time we would ask questions about the drinks the waitress would have to go ask the bartender. It's a specialty cocktail lounge- we aren't liquor micro-biologists asking for a chemical analysis of their concoctions- just regular basic questions. It would have been nice if she would have had some level of knowledge and training- given the niche and price points. \\\\ \\n\\nAll in all- I remember when this place was hot, back in the day- when I don't think I was even old enough to drink. It's still a nice place, but there are so many more options in this town now. Urbanity in Phoenix is progressing- gotta keep up with the times Merc Bar. When my barista knowns more about the soymilk in my Latte than this chick knows about a fresh squeezed lemon in a cocktail we have an issue. \\n\\nAs for the drinks... They were okay.

When you take a shower water came up to my ankles and there was crud in it. Grossss. The upside of this hotel is not the rooms, but the casino itself. Yes it is older and kind of ghetto, but the dealertainers were very entertaining, we even ran into \\\"Michael Jackson\\\" in the elevator and had a little chat with him. I wouldn't ever stay in a room here again, but its not a bad place to check out and play some poker with the dealertainers.\n",

      "Review :  We decided to check out Howl at the Moon since we were getting used to same old songs and routines at The Big Bang in Tempe. We went in around 8:30 or 9 on Friday night and there still plenty of tables to sit at and there was a 7 dollar cover. The bar itself is well stocked and looks very clean and presentable with good prices for Old Town and they bring around interesting shots like jello shots in large plastic syringes! So it's definitely a good place to stop by for a few drinks before going elsewhere.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the talent on stages range from average to laughably bad, particularly for a Friday night! One of the musicians attempted to play Green Day on the guitar but was playing the wrong chords while smirking with the other musicians, clearly aware that he sucked. One of the singers was apparently tone-deaf, but fortunately the sound guy realized this and kept the mic level so low you could barely hear it. Instead, we just kind of got the idea that they were playing a familiar song. They also attempted some kind of cringe-worthy \\\"stomp\\\" routine which consisted of banging on trash cans with drumsticks which was supposed to rile up the crowd but mostly cause a headache. It's nice that they have other instruments like trumpet or flute available for the entertainers, but it would be nicer if they knew how to play them. When they stuck to the basics with singing and playing the piano, they did well, but I kept having the feeling that they were seeing how poorly they can play while still entertaining the crowd (and getting paid). I think with time, they will find consistent talent, but at this point, I'm sticking with the Big Bang for my piano bar fix.\n",

      "Review :  It had been years since I had been back to Rito's, I was craving it for lunch and thought let's do an old school affordable lunch.  I typically eat Burrito's at the Lunch Trucks so I thought Rito's being in the middle of the hood, nothing fancy, outdoor seating and so on should be a quick affordable quick lunch for two of us.  We got our Two Burrito's after waiting almost 30 minutes in their lobby + the 10+ we spent in line? (I know I know...what did I expect going there between 11am-1pm...but seriously they have all the ingredients made, it's just an assembly line, Chipotle Style dang it) so anyway, the food took way too long and $17.49 later for one green chile regular burrito and one red enchilada style burrito with rice and beans (in the hood) had me complaining about my planned 'cheap' lunch before I took my first bite.  \\nI'm not gonna lie the burrito's are tasty and a good size, other comments mentioned salty and greasy and yes that is true on both, but that's why the place is famous for its simple salty/greasy food.  I have had better for the same or less $$ and for a much better atmosphere...that place is making a killing they could have maybe some more shaded cheap/vintage seating a sign a mural something...give the place a little character and I can maybe feel better about spending my hard earned $$ there.  Anyway not my most favorable review but I think Rito's has taken their fame to their head and caters to the foodies/downtown administrative crowd vs. the working class and neighborhood area peeps.\n",

The cozy old fashioned decor is hard to walk past without wanting a taste.\\nThe reviews are misleading. Out of 5 different flavors, including cookies n cream and cookie dough, we were left completely dissatisfied both times. The ice cream is more on the icy side than creamy and it is flat out bland. There flavors are basic and there's nothing unique going on with any of them. The topper was the waffle bowl itself. It was soft, soggy and really just embarrassing.

On our visit there with friends tonight, the staff was friendly, but the food at this new location was a huge disappointment.\\n\\nThe house-made tortillas looked soft and wonderful when we were ordering at the counter, but the enchilada fillings and sauces for those tortillas all turned out to be overly sugared.  When I ordered the green chili sauce for my enchiladas, I was expecting something that would be mostly green.  Instead, the sauce was brown and thick, and any chilis in it were hard to spot.   Then when the entree was heated after it was assembled, the bottom part of the enchiladas was practically fused to the bottom of the aluminum tray, and it was hard to cut with the plastic cutlery. \\n\\nI won't be going back, but if circumstances put me there again I'd start with one of those beautiful tortillas and be very careful about what I ordered to put inside or on top of it.\n",

Took an hour and fifteen minutes to get food. Complained after 45 minutes and they said they'll bring out some complimentary appetizers. The complimentary appetizers were brought out by a young guy who called himself a chef. He explained his experimental apps- torched cocoa powder. It was a dish. With cocoa powder on it. That he pointed a torch at. At first I thought he was making a joke, and then I felt a little insulted. Another half hour later, and our food came out. Which was edible at least.

      "Review :  Drove through this one today determined to try one of the thick yellow Lemonade's I always see advertised. I ordered a large and drove up to the window. What I got was a solid white concoction and very watery. I took a sip and not only was it barely cool in temperature, but tasted like a solid block of sugar. No lemon to be found anywhere, and certainly not the thick cold looking drink advertised.  I knocked on the drive thru window repeatedly as the girl who waited on me had closed it, for what seemed like an eternity. When she finally came to the window with a disdainful look on her face asking what I wanted.  I explained the issue and not only did she not offer to remake it, she seemed pissed that I had a beef. When I suggested an Orange Julius instead or something comparable, she only pointed out the higher price difference. I then asked for a large diet soda, which she obliged but didn't bother to refund the difference in price. (I should have got back at least .40 cents) Clearly the advertised product and what you will find waiting for you at the window are two different things. I guess what made me the most dissatisfied is her complete lack of interest in giving me what I paid for, and essentially a \\\"what do you want me to do about it\\\" attitude. Does this place even have a manager? I wonder. Clearly customer service is not something they strive for here. And management if you're reading this, here's a tip; If you're going to advertise a THICK, COLD, LEMON drink, you need to deliver. What was handed to me today was pathetic, not to mention the crappy customer service. I won't be back.\n",

The server seemed nice, though ill informed and overburdened with customers. \\nThe owner was flitting about, not being overhelpful and scantily dressed. Is it wrong to have something like a uniform in a restaurant these days or at least dress like you have some kind of pride in what you do? To pay 125$ for a bottle of wine and ROOM TEMP oysters, cool fried cat tails, sad sad sad greens, a few pieces of duck breast and some unidentifiable deep fried stuff( best thing we ate) is a bit scandalous I think. It took an astounding 40 minutes after our ordering for the food to arrive in the sad state it did, the temperature suggested perhaps it was ready and waiting 10 minutes before.\\nThe general vibe is one of confusion and frankly I cannot imagine ever going back, shameful as I found the concept intriguing and inspiring.\n",

      "Review :  OK, so this was my first visit to ANY Capriotti's and was expecting good things. I order their \\\"Capastrami which is a 9\\\" pastrami sandwich served on a roll with Russian dressing and cole slaw. I ask to have the cole slaw served on the side instead of in the sandwich, which they did. It took them a little more than 5 minutes to prepare it. Now I have eaten enough pastrami in my life to know that good pastrami has been salt cured and has a bold spicy, smoke infused flavor. Capriotti's pastrami tasted almost totally bland. Even the saltiness had somehow been leached out of it. The sandwich roll had obviously been microwaved which results in toughening up its natural soft baked texture. The cole slaw was mediocre and not particularly flavorful.\\n\\nWhat a HUGE disappointment! Overall, this turned out to be one of the 2 worst pastrami sandwiches I've ever been served. I know that Capriotti's has now become another big multi-state franchise chain. I don't know how they managed to achieve that status by serving such a wretched sandwich.\n",

My plates were cleaned, the flavors were immense, and damn, were the desserts heavenly.\\n\\nFast forward now - even for their price, which is consider on the more affordable hotel buffets, just leaves me with a stomach that hurts. I like that they have so many options - seriously, you'll burn some of the calories just walking back and forth, searching for your table because you were too hungry to remember as you dashed to the seafood station. The taco station is a nice visit if you're interested in making your own tacos, hard shell and all.\\n\\nThe dessert station, which I used to be quite fond of, is now mediocre. It's like everything is just tossed together - no flavor. Just loaded with sugar and HFCS. The gelato is good, but I would say that about many other buffets serving gelato.\\n\\nYes, the lines are long. I never had a problem in the past because for the most part, I went through the Diamond line. And the few times I waited in the regular line, it was at odd times, so I barely waited.

I pretty much drowned it with hoisen and chili sauce just to make it almost taste like the Pho most people know.

      "Review :  I have never written a review before, but after a restaurant experience like this one, I felt as though it was necessary. Myself and 3 others came here after our finding out the restaurant we originally wanted to go to had an hour wait. Honestly, we would have been better off waiting an hour for that place. Our worst decision of the evening was choosing this restaurant. We were seated right away, but didn't receive our actual meals until an hour later. We received our appetizers fairly quickly, but 30 minutes went by after that and we hadn't heard anything about where our food was. Servers were coming out of the kitchen left and right with everyone's plate but ours. Our server then told us that they were backed up. It wasn't that busy in there at the time, and it sure didn't seem like they were backed up if everyone around us were getting their dinners. We even saw people sit down after us, finish their meals, and leave! We stopped another waiter and asked what could be taking so long, and he said they were just busy. We waited, and waited. The man who sat us seemed to be the owner/manager of the place, so we got his attention and kindly asked if he could check on our food because now it's been 40 minutes since our appetizers. He preceded to argue with us and say \\\"I know when I sat you, and I sat you 20 minutes ago!\\\" I've never had the owner of a restaurant basically call us liars and talk so rudely to us. How he could stand there and say that in a stern voice to us when we were the ones sitting there looking at our watches the whole time - I'll never know.\\n\\n The management was just terrible. That is $15 I'll never spend on a meal there again. We were thrilled to finish our food and receive our checks. Hopefully they'll read the note we left on the back of our receipt..but I have a feeling they could care less if they ever see their customers twice because they get a lot of one timer tourists. Oh, and their bread was extremely hard and cold. Awful experience.\n",

The food at this Olive Garden location simply sucks compared to other local Italian restaurant places you can find in the Charlotte area.  This is just another chain Italian restaurant that should be ignored unless you are in a city that only has the Olive Garden as an Italian option. Goodbye Olive Garden.

      "Review :  I would have to say the best thing about CSS is the interior.  Very well done and offers a great ambiance.  The food on the other hand was rather disappointing.  I tried the Brisket, Spare Ribs, Sausage, potato salad, mac and cheese and corn bread.  For the most part everything was pretty bland and lacked a good smoke flavor.  The brisket was moist but no ring which leads me to believe it was put on the smoker to give it some color but then was taken off and wrapped and placed in an oven.  The sausage had a good smoky color and flavor but the spices within the sausage were nothing more than you find in a store bought sausage.  My sides were overall bland and the corn bread was very dry.  \\nI was able to try some samples from my friends meals and I would say the beef rib was very well done and tasty.  The pie was also very good.  \\nThe food is served cafeteria style which is difficult for me to get past, It lends itself to questioning how long ago the food was prepared.  Also I did not get a strong smell of smoke inside the restaurant.  \\nOverall I think CSS would be a viable BBQ option for the area if they were not located right next to another BBQ joint.  They have stiff competition and currently are lacking in the flavor department by a long way.\n",

It is hard to respect a restaurant that serves cold butter in foil packets, not olive oil. Service was very slow, despite it being not that busy for a Saturday night. Had to wait a couple of times with empty waters, even had to flag a different waiter to top us off. The calamari was very good - tender, not greasy, and just a light dusting of breading. The meal took forever to arrive, despite being just a salad (DRENCHED in dressing) and an entree. The main entree was cold, as was the plate. Clearly the plate had been sitting in queue for some time (I had a hunch since the folks who came in after us, a party of four, were served first, and attentively at that). My mother voiced the complaint to the owner that the entree was cold but he barely seemed to acknowledge - he seems to be flighty and not that accomodating. Might want to up your customer service skills.

This was my 4th time eating here and quite possibly my last. \\n\\nFirst, I ordered the speciality fried rice (The server described it as \\\"the white fried rice and not the dark\\\") It came with chopped pork, chicken and whole shrimp. The shrimp had their intestinal tracks still intact. The chicken was really dry which makes me think they used old leftover pre cooked chicken. And the rice was hard and some pieces were crunchy. When fried rice gets stuck in my teeth, it's not good fried rice. \\n\\nI also ordered the rare beef Pho. When the server brought the plate of Jalapenos, bean sprouts, and thai basil, the jalapenos were dry and rotting, the basil came wilted and had a lot of brown spots. I asked her to change it out and she did. \\n\\nUsually whenever I get Pho, it comes steaming hot. Since I only saw little puff of steam, I knew I was in trouble. I went to stir it and the noodles on the bottom were still clumped together, and a small ice cube was in the noodles! I pulled it out and kept stirring the Pho to loosen the noodles. Usually when I get the rare beef, the soup cooks it because its so hot. Not this time... After I tasted it, I called the server over and asked her if she could warm it up in the microwave because it was luke warm. After 15 mins, the little old lady in the back came out with the Pho and said that if I order rare beef it will stay rare. I told her that was fine, but I didnt want cold soup. \\n\\nWhen I got the Pho back, I could tell she just boiled the hell out of it because it was full of floaters from the cooked blood from the rare beef. It just looked disgusting. I couldnt eat it, and asked for my check. Instead of making things better, the server just gave me the check and I paid 25.00 for NOTHING. (I did drink my Thai tea)  \\n\\nThere was a total lack of service. There was only one other person during my entire visit. Nobody ever really checked on my table.

My mother and I each got the pulled pork and my dad decided to get a combo with 1/3 rack of ribs and one side for 9.99.\\n\\nWell when we got the food home I was in for a bit of a disappointment.  The menu says of the pulled pork:  \\\"Slowly smoked seasoned pork topped with creamy coleslaw.\\\"  Fair enough, I'm used to good sized pulled pork sandwiches with a heaping amount of coleslaw.  There was a very moderate portion of pork but the real bummer was that the coleslaw was not on the sandwich, but a minuscule portion on the side in a one ounce cup- filled half way- even trying to spread it thin I couldn't get it to reach to the end of the bun.  The pork itself didn't have much flavor, I was desperately wishing for some sort of sauce to put on to give it some taste, but of course a side of sauce is sixty cents extra.\\n\\nMy dad said the ribs were good but they were also pretty meager and his side of mac and cheese was of similar proportion. \\n\\nWe did get a side of fries which were very good, other than that the place was a big let down.\n",

      "Review :  Okay concept, poorly executed.\\n\\nVisited on a Thursday night around 8 p.m. My biggest grief with this place is that they served me a warm beer. A warm beer! When I called the waitress out on it, she said, \\\"Well I don't know how that could have happened.\\\" She was nice enough to replace it at no cost but seriously. \\n\\nThe table next to us was full of tourists who all ordered Spotted Cows and the waitress said they were out. Really? You're a pub in downtown Madison called the Tipsy Cow and you're out of Madison's favorite beer? \\n\\nMy fiance liked his burger, I ordered a BLT which I figured would be hard to mess up. It wasn't spectacular. We also ordered the truffle fries, which were good, but it doesn't take a genius to serve French fries covered in truffle oil with a side of garlic aoli. Of course it's going to be good.\\n\\nI expected a lot more out of the place and was disappointed. It will be awhile before we give it another try.\n",

      "Review :  Firstly, I was so excited that a Pita Jungle opened in Ahwatukee. I have been going to the Chandler and Tempe locations for many, many years and was always more than willing to make the drive because I love it there. Until recently, I was frequenting the Ahwatukee location on average of 1 - 2 times a week to meet friends for lunch. However, the last four times (in a row!) that I have been there, the service was abhorrent, and the food sub-par. \\n\\nHere are some basic, common sense rules of thumb that the Ahwatukee Pita Jungle wait staff should learn to adhere to:\\n\\n1) When customers order appetizers, soup and an entree, a waiter/waitress is supposed bring the appetizer out first, then the soup, then the entree. They aren't supposed to bring it out all at once and crowd it onto the table allowing most of what you ordered to get cold. This happened the last three times I was there. \\n\\n2) It is absolutely disgusting when you see a waitress wiping down tables then, without washing their hands, turn around and pick your glass up by the freaking brim and refill your drink. NASTY! \\n\\n3) It really shouldn't take 3 people to wait on a table of two. Especially when wait staff cannot effectively communicate with one another. Things inevitably get screwed up. It isn't a confusing job - I waited and bartended for years and have infinite patience and respect for those in the service industry, but Jesus H Christ, where do they find the staff here? The other locations aren't like this!\\n\\nAnyways, I could keep going, but why bother? Don't waste your time at this location. the Chandler location on Ray and Dobson is only 10 minutes away and it is soooo much better!\n",

It was crowded (a good sign)?  After nearly 5 minutes in line I saw a woman and her child leave as the place was under staffed and the wait went on and on.    With no end near we decided to bail and give c4 a strike 2. \\n\\nIt's unfortunate as the food has always been good but someone get chef Ramsay to come in and give them the 101 on service. \\n\\nWe will wait a few months before trying again.  I'd much rather go to Harold's or Red Truck Cafe in the interm.\n",

      "Review :  I went to this salon on a whim, as I was desperate to get a haircut and color before my scheduled trip. I called on a Friday, and they were able to get me in. I arrived for My appointment on time which was scheduled for 2:15, I didn't get called until 2:40. My stylist Rosie, was nice,  I explained to her what I wanted and we talked about several options on how to get there. Once we agreed on the hair color, I noticed that after she came back from mixing the color, her hands smelled like cigarette smoke. (I can't stand that smell). We talked, and she is very nice. However, I didn't like that she never once checked on me while I was sitting there with the color on my hair, until I started getting a tingling/burn feeling on my scalp.. I asked one of the other stylist if they could call her from the back. My hair looked great but the lightening in the salon isn't that great so I couldn't really see a difference in my shade. Once I got home I noticed that I a had a mess of a hair color. The top part (roots) were alot lighter than the bottom. I called to see if I could reschedule. I got an appointment scheduled for the following day, only for them to call me to tell me she had called in sick. So now I'm off on my scheduled trip looking like a skunk.

      "Review :  I've eaten at Vino's inside the Cannery Casino several times, and the food has always been very good, as it was on our last outing three days ago. But this time there was a noticeable failure in service, to the point that after I ordered Calamari Fritti with both marinara sauce and lemon aioli to serve as an appetizer, not only did neither sauce arrive. Neither did the Calamari! First came a tasty cup of Minestrone Soup chock-full of vegetables, and a fine Caesar Salad of fresh romaine lettuce big enough to serve two, accompanied by addictive soft Italian rolls topped by garlic, over which I generously applied butter. In fact I downed four of them as we waited for the Calamari that never arrived. When our ordered entrees were at last delivered to the table about 30 minutes later, I mentioned to the server to take off the order of Calamari since it never came, and he just smiled and said, \\\"Sure!\\\" as if nothing was amiss. \\n\\nMy Linguine and Clams in white wine sauce was all I hoped it would be. The sauce was billed as \\\"buttery,\\\" and that it was. But, although my wife's shrimp in Alfredo Sauce had been specially requested by her to have no vegetables in it and be served with fettuccine rather than angel hair pasta, it came instead with bits of spinach (which she manually pulled out) and angel hair pasta. It is aggravating when a good meal is spoiled by lack of attention to orders--either by the server or in the kitchen! \\n\\nWe will try Vino's again, because the food is really worth the visit when it is prepared as ordered, and we live nearby. But I am dismayed by the multiple errors in order taking, food preparation, and delivery that just turned what could have been a four-star experience into an aggravating two-star visit.\n",

I decided not to eat my remaining beef taco, instead I gave it to my husband who ditched the lettuce, cheese and shell and added the beef to his already skimpy taco. The food was along the same line as Taco Bell. I don't dislike Taco Bell, I just prefer real Mexican food.\\n\\nThe guac was not bad, it was also covered in cheddar cheese.\n",

All this while watching his wait staff run arounds without a thought of running some food or helping them get out of the weeds. He was just texting on his phone or drinking a beer at the bar.

There are other tile stores in town that carry much of the same merchandise, and their staff was much more helpful at helping me find items in their stores that they thought would meet what I was looking for.

If I had a couple weeks to wait for the other stores to order my tile, I would have saved about half and been treated better.  Mexican Tile & Stone had what I wanted in stock, so I paid full retail prices to get it.  Paying such a premium I mistakenly thought I'd get a premium product, but much of it had serious paint and/or glazing defects requiring me to rifle through the supply in their warehouse to get tiles that didn't look significantly different from each other.  Before this last step, the sales girl had made sure to have me sign TWO waivers about these being hand-made tiles and that I should expect variations.  Variation is one thing, and in the QC world variation has an acceptable tolerance range. Many of the tiles they tried to send home with me were downright defective and unquestionably outside any range of acceptable variation.  There weren't enough of the \\\"good\\\" tiles for my project, so I took a few of the best of the bad and had my tile installer mix them in the project so they weren't so visible.  However, I notice them every time I look at it and it really bugs me I spent full retail for these tiles.

That is supporting local businesses and leaving your visitors with a wonderful last impression.\\n\\nNext, the food. My expectations were low. I'm totally cool with burgers, hot dogs and fries. But when the burger patty came out, it honestly looked like a fast food burger vs. something I'm paying $15 for. That didn't bode well given there were plenty of fast food options I could have gone with.\\n\\nThe server was nice enough but not very efficient. She was holding my plastic silverware (oh yes, everything is served on plastic) WHILE talking to another customer. I was puzzled.\\n\\nBottom line: DON'T EAT HERE. Grab a to-go from the fast food or sandwich places. If you must have a beer, then go ahead... it's more about the experience of chatting with fellow travelers vs. getting an interesting beer.\n",

The food was overcooked and the waiter did not come back to ask us anything after it was served (he came by at the end to give us the check).  Had to ask for most things twice (sugar for tea, mustard, straws).  Does the Chef not care that he has such crappy service??!  There are so many other places to eat in Vegas, one would think that Simon does not want to be one of the crappy places (wait, too late..).\n",

I was excited to go there as I had not been there before and had usually wondered what it was like as we go to the palms a lot and drive by the signage.\\n \\nI started with an order of calamari that came with a ponzu based sauce that also came with shishito peppers $9.  The calamari was a little on the chewy side but had a nice flavor on its own, the sauce however was a bit thick and very over powering to the palate. The peppers were nice though.\\n\\nMy boss had a Caesar salad $12, which he thought was very nice.\\nMy boss ordered the Ribeye \\\"filet\\\" with tempura shishito peppers, ponzu sauce $42 I ordered the dry aged New York Strip with fingerling potato coins (like 5 little slices) $39. Sides here are ordered separately and since we already had appetizer and salad, we opted for just the steaks.\\n\\nBoth steaks I feel had the same problem, the very thick Ribeye \\\"filet\\\" and the New York were pretty cooked on one side less on the other and over seasoned to the point my taste buds were getting that salty burning feeling. Not to mention I would cut off most of the over seared side. They came with a b\\u00e9arnaise sauce and demi-glace sauce, which were both very nice.\\n\\nThe server was initially there to take orders fast etc., the water server was always Johnny on the spot, but then the server was ghost. I noted that when the assistants would bring out food they would mess up a lot on the seating and who gets what as it happened to us (I know this from working in restaurants myself). In the end, we had to wait about 15 minutes to ask for our bill and wait for him to bring the actual bill.\\n\\nThe place was beautiful but the atmosphere was very loud.

The sweet onion flat bread and pork belly appetizer dish were both great and super as a combination but some of the dishes are just bad combination of flavors.  Also, twice I have gone in and the entire place smelled like 5 day old fish they cooked anyway.  No restaurant should smell like that.\\n\\nThey have a robust evening crowd especially on Friday and Saturday and the outdoor seating is nice.  Unfortunately, the waiters tend to forget about you.

The flavor was okay, the quality of the lamb and beef were good, and the portion was right.  It's what you would expect of a quality szechuan place.\\n\\nThe pork intestines with hot peppers was a bad dish.  The intestines were properly cooked, but there was ZERO flavor with the dish.

I missed a night of work. The hospital and ambulance is billing me for $5000. Needless to say I will not be eating there again. \\n\\nBut since no one that we know of reported getting sick but me. It was an isolated incident, and one I won't forget. What I was hoping for was an apology, and at least an offer to find out what happened. They didn't even ask if I were alright, and if I had any info from the hospital on what happened, and if they should be concerned.\n",

      "Review :  I've been a loyal Yelp user for a a couple of years but always hesitant to share my dining experiences with others.  After our dining \\\"experience\\\" tonight, the hesitation is over....\\n\\nWe had a Madison Originals gift certificate expiring, so rather than burning it, we decided that we would have a rare Sunday night out.  Their website indicated that Sunday was Family Night and kids ate free, so we were excited to check it out.  We got to the restaurant just before 6:00 and there were maybe 7 or 8 tables of diners.  We sat outside since the weather was nice.  Server was very friendly even though it was a bit odd that they didn't have any kid's menus given that it was \\\"Family Night.\\\"  \\n\\nOur server was at our table promptly and took our drink order.  When our drinks showed up, I asked if there were any options on the kid's menu other than what I could pull up on my Smartphone.  Before I could finish my question, he ran off and said he would get us a kid's menu... 20 minutes later we now had a new server and a kid's menu.  Not sure what happened to the original server but our kids thought it was odd that he disappeared.\\n\\nI asked the new server what she recommended for entrees and she suggested the tilapia, ribs, and jambalaya.  I order the tilapia and my wife ordered the salmon.  Our son ordered the mac and cheese and our daughter the mushroom pasta.  10 minutes later, the server came back and said the mushroom pasta was gone, so she got the mac and cheese too.\\n\\nAround 20 minutes later our drinks were long gone and the server brought out the kids meals and said ours were on the way.  Kids asked for some ketchup, which never did show up.....\\n\\nWhile our meals were \\\"on the way,\\\" the kids progressed to eat most of their food while we waited and waited.  Eventually our food showed up.  I thought mine was good.  My wife wasn't impressed with her salmon or risotto.  We ended up eating the rest of the kids mac and cheese and thought that was might tasty!\\n\\nAfter about a half an hour the server finally checked on our table again.  We promptly asked for our bill.  When she brought it out, we paid without seeing the bill as the kids had to get to bed on a school night and we had already been there for 1.5 hours.  After a while, the wife and kids went to the car while I continued to wait.  The table next to us went inside to pay as they had waited long enough too.  After over 20 minutes, the server asked if I got my bill back.  I reminded her that she took it but never brought it back.  \\n\\nThankfully when the check and my credit card re-surfaced, it was actually processed correctly.  Had it been wrong, I'd probably still be sitting there....\\n\\nWhile the food is alright, the service is horrendous.  Diner beware!\n",

The tracking update said the product was delivered to our front door. I was home waiting for the package to be delivered. There was no attempt on the delivery person's side to knock or hand the package over to me. This lack of responsibility constitutes as terrible service. I have no idea where my package is, but hopefully I'll be getting a refund from Amazon.\n",

However, this review is solely based upon my experience at the Las Vegas boutique...\\n\\nI excitedly walked into the store and began browsing.  Two male sales associates were standing in the front room talking to one another.  Neither one of them acknowledged me.  I immediately noticed a soft leather briefcase on a top-shelf and turned to ask one of the salesmen for assistance.  However, they could not be bothored since their pending lunch was quite the important topic.  I stood there for a good 20 seconds and finally managed an \\\"excuse me.\\\" One walked away, and the other slowly turned his head, gave me a blank stare, followed by \\\"yessss...\\\"  I pointed and asked him if he knew the price of the briefcase off the top of his head.  He then ROLLED HIS EYES, walked and stood in front of the briefcase, and said something like \\\"it's around $3,000 I think\\\" and just continued to stare at me.

      "Review :  The two stars is purely for the view, which is simply fantastic; and for the service, which was delightful (servers were polite and attentive)\\n\\nWe were here with the Travelzoo voucher, and I'd say the food was abysmal. Frankly, lunch earlier that day at Grand Lux Cafe in the Palazzo was leagues better and cost less than half the price.\\n\\nFirstly, the 'free' cocktail that came with the set came in a cheap plastic glass, and was so watered down that neither of us finished more than half. The food was equally bland - tasteless, not very fresh, and frankly, difficult to stomach. I really did not know if they were saving the truly good food for people who paid full price for the tasting menu, or if the restaurant really sucked. Truly, even a great chef would not serve disgusting food even if it was a discounted set. It was really hard to believe that the place had a michelin star in 2008 and 2009.\\n\\nAgain, the only reason why this does not get 1 star was because of the phenomenal view (ask to sit by the windows when you place a reservation), and the service. (they say 'voila!' and serve you your plates with a flourish!) Having said that, i would not visit this restaurant again.\n",

Finally after 20 minutes, they finally gave in and let the 5 of us sit down since our other few weren't eating. I found this sort of annoying as the bar was pretty full (we were all in heels) and we asked to be seated a few times... But OOHH well. \\n\\nServer: Our server was pretty darn occupied with the hostesses. I am in the industry, so I understand how this works. But COMMONNN pay attention to us!! The people in our party had to go up to the bar after we were seated because he was so busy trying to meet the ladies!! \\n\\nFood Quality: Mine was decent. I had the filet. I felt the mashed potatoes were missing something, they were dying for truffle or something savory. My steak was a little over cooked. \\n\\nIssue: A girl at our table's steak was WAY undercooked. Our server didnt come around for awhile, so she watched us eat. They re-cooked the same steak to re-cook it. I think this is NASTY. I would expect this at an Applebees, but not here. EW! Dont but a steak that was on a persons germy fork back on the grill!!\\n\\nPrices: For the food quality... You must be joking! There are much much better places to eat for the same price. \\n\\nDrink Prices: $16-$40 for their drinks. Pretty pricey, but they are tasty. I dont think they are very strong, we had two BIG ones and we were still sober afterwards... $80 for two. \\n\\nThey also didnt do ANYTHING for her Bday!! It was a little awkward. I wasn't expecting a song or dance, but a free shot or a comped dessert would have gone a LONG way. Each person in our party left with a $60+ tab. I probably wouldnt go back, its just too pricey for the quality in my opinion. I really wouldnt want to repeat that. \\n\\nI did meet a super nice club promoter for the club next door. He really hooked my group of friends up, you can message me for his info if you need it. He really saved the night since dinner was kinda Blah.\n",

The indoor layout of the casino is labyrinthine and confusing. There is a more-prominent-than-usual smoky smell. The parking is alright when you can find it. \\n\\nHowever this hotel is on the cool side of the strip-very close to NYNY,  MGM, and the Gameworks/food court area. Location is very important when you are in a drunken haze and need to stumble back!\\n\\nThe rooms are once again, fine if you are just in vegas to party or relax, but not of the caliber you would want if you were taking a girl (or guy) here with romantic intentions. The beds are fine and well enough to fall on after an exhausting day of drinking and walking and cussing at slot machines. The bathrooms are really nice though, a strange contrast to the room itself. \\n\\nOverall I'd come here again for maybe a quick weekend trip with my bros to club or whatever.

If you pay out the ass to go to the Rehab pool party do not set foot in the hotel without a shirt on. You will be called out, yelled at and confronted by security. The lines at the front desk are endless. The parking garage is a nightmare. Park at your own risk. They do not consider themselves responsible for anything that happens to their own paying customer's vehicles. Do not let them put you in the Casino Tower. It is the oldest tower and looks it. Half the time you go to one of the bars they are unattended. No bartender needed for no customers. All in all, there are so many other places in Vegas to stay and gamble that treat you like they're glad you're there and they want you to come back. if you want a good time surrounded by fun people  try Planet Hollywood or The Palms or, last but not least , The Cosmopolitan.\n",

      "Review :  I found this place via Groupon and went with a friend for lunch. The building it is located in in very charming and the patio would be great once the weather cools down a bit. Some of the decor inside the restaurant seems a little outdated but overall I found it very charming and cute - in a downtown Glendale kinda way :) The owner greeted us as we walked in and seated us at a small table right by the front door. As instructed by Groupon we informed him that we had a voucher. I asked him how long the restaurant had been open since this was the first time I had been here and he told me that the restaurant had been open for 5 years and that they were very busy and successful. I didn't want to read into his demeanor, but he came across somewhat arrogant. We decided that we wanted to try several of the dishes and ordered the Greek salad, the cheese and ham plate with toasted bread and the prosciutto bruchetta. The food was good and very tasty but the owner and staff are something else. When we placed the order the owner said something like \\\"well you Groupon people order so much because you have a voucher\\\". I was thinking to myself that if he doesn't want \\\"groupon people\\\" then maybe he shouldn't put out a Groupon. Total turnoff. I enjoy trying new places and Groupon is a great way to find them, therefore I will not be made to feel guilty for using one.

It is a casual spot where the food it pretty much pre-prepared and being heated in the windows at the counter. This restaurant has pizza, salads, pasta, sandwiches, and baked goods. I ordered one of the specials, chicken parmesan with a side of penne alla vodka. The chicken was so bland that I felt like I was eating boiled chicken. As my husband put it, it tasted like diet food but without the benefits of diet food because of the breading. The pasta was also weirdly bland and spicy. The spicy part really surprised me because I have never had it spicy. My husband had the penne alla campagna (1/2) and another (1/2) penne dish that we can't remember. His were slightly better than mine but not by much. It is sad that the best part of the meal was the pepperoni pizza we bought for kids. Would I go there again? Probably not. For 4 adults and 2 kids, we spent $65 which I find disappointing for an extremely mediocre meal. I suppose for people that work close by (it is downtown at Central and Adams), it is a nice convenience but if I wanted Italian food, I'd probably choose Pasta Bar.\n",

Seriously, of the 15 to 20 times I have eaten here, the servers always disappear...for like 20 minutes. Are they all addicted to cigarettes? Are there company meetings between customers when I visit? Is staff on staff flirting the best use of company time since they don't seem to care about their tips? You may be asking yourself, why do I eat here if the service is so awful? Answer: 1. This is the better Japanese food near my work, 2. the prices are reasonable, 3.hmmm now you have me wondering why...\\n\\nIf you are here for some food and not to get wasted, you're on your hour lunch break, or you actually want to have a nice meal with people you enjoy I would not recommend going to the RA on Mill. Service is unexpected. I have gone in when there are only two or three tables, ordered regular food (not even sushi), then waited for no one since my waiter was nowhere to be found then had to get to go boxes before I could even start eating because it took sooooo long.\\n\\nIf you can make it to another location however, I do like the lunch Bento boxes, great deal for the money. You get Miso (which I don't eat since they use fish) ((*Tip for other vegetarians: their Tempura sauce also contains fish)), uchi no salad (good when made right, I'll even order the full size as my entr\\u00e9e sometimes), rice, a spinach gyoza, a vegetable spring roll, and your entr\\u00e9e. When I ate meat I liked the Chicken Katsu or the Chicken Teriyaki (the sauce is very very light, almost too light though). I also like the Veggie Tempura (I just use a tiny bit of soy for the sauce). They have pineapple cheese wontons which are pretty tasty but I wouldn't order them outside of their happy hour prices. Their spicy chicken teriyaki udon packs a punch and is nose sniffing hot. Make sure to add in the extra red sauce from around the bowl to get the full experience. When I'm in the mood for some sushi I will order cucumber avocado rolls. They actually have a very good dessert...it's tempura fried ice cream (it's big so make sure you have someone to share it with), it's sliced into four pieces and served with a berry sauce.\n",

      "Review :  I grew up in Birmingham, AL and this was literally the worst BBQ restaurant I have been to in my life (39 years). If you didn't grow up with BBQ, please don't think that what they serve at Pot Liquor is BBQ. Even Famous Dave's is better than this garbage.\\n\\nThe pulled pork was cooked at too high a temperature for too short a time, so the outside was hard and inedible and the fat and connective tissue didn't break down like it is supposed to, making the interior meat also mostly inedible.\\n\\nThey serve what they call \\\"Alabama Sweet Tea\\\". To me, it tasted like unsweetened tea. In the south, sweet tea is extremely sweet. I understand toning it down a little bit for those not used to it, but this was extremely bland. I complained and they brought me another glass from a different batch, but it was the same.\\n\\nTheir sauces have the non-descriptive names of Cue #1 thru Cue #4. I had to ask what they were. I tried all of them and they were terrible. I think #4 was their \\\"Alabama White Sauce\\\". Instead of being a tangy thin white sauce that can penetrate down into the meat, it was basically 98% mayonnaise with a little bit of seasoning. Disgusting.\\n\\nThey couldn't get basics right, and most of the rest of the menu consists of inappropriate fancy modifications of southern food.\\nExamples include:\\n\\\"Fried Catfish Benedict\\\": Fried catfish should be able to stand on its own. hollandaise sauce is completely inappropriate.\\n\\\"Devil'd Eggs\\\": topped with deep fried chicken skin. The flavor of the skin completely overpowered the egg.\\n\\\"Brownie Bread Pudding\\\": bread pudding is already very sweet if made correctly and chocolate is not an appropriate flavor combination. Then they serve it with \\\"sea salt vanilla gelato\\\". If you asked for \\\"sea salt vanilla gelato\\\" in a real BBQ place in the south, they would laugh at you and probably throw you out.\\n\\\"Fried Pies\\\": this sounds pretty basic but the description says it is served with \\\"malted anglaise\\\". What the heck?\\n\\\"Strawberry Shortcake Sandwiches\\\": sounds pretty straight forward but it comes with strawberry cream gelato. Again with the gelato!\\n\\\"Kansas City Style Burnt Ends\\\": Another staple. But they shake \\\"sugar in the raw\\\" over the top. The burnt ends were good but the sugar made the experience unpleasant. Really? You can put sugar on meat that shouldn't have it but you can't put it in your sweet tea?\\n\\nI told them their chef needs to visit Alabama and learn how to make real southern food. They assured me that he HAD visited Alabama and spent a whole 10 days there. You can't learn BBQ in 10 days. Good BBQ chefs have spent well over 10 years learning to make it. Pot Liquor does not serve southern BBQ or any southern dishes. I may try them again in a couple years if they haven't gone out of business. Perhaps by then they will have found a cook book and learned to make some actual southern food.\n",

I have been here numerous times with my family but for the past couple times I've been out here its been so terrible. They don't offer you free water anymore as you wait, the people there look miserable, they aren't personable as before, and the food tastes bland. I really feel that this place has some personal issues because the service speaks for itself, horrible. I am definitely searching for a new place to take my family to eat pho.\n",

      "Review :  After reading so many glowing reviews, I was completely convinced I had found my forever salon. I've jumped around between many salons in the past because I never felt like hairdressers really understood what I wanted. \\n\\nI went to Dre's several weeks ago and I initially felt like I was in the right place. The salon is bright, new and really beautiful. Everyone was so nice (I can't stress this enough) and greeted me as soon as I walked in. \\n\\nWhen I first sat in the chair and showed pictures of what I wanted, I thought me and the hairdresser were on the same page. I wanted brighter, non-foiled highlights in a really ashy tone. We discussed extra face framing highlights as well. My hair was pretty gold and had grown out highlights, so it looked almost like an ombre going in. The color job was quick and I only processed for a very short time (as a person who has had my hair bleached countless time, this should have been a major red flag). \\n\\nOnce she started drying it (after a trim), I was so puzzled... it looked exactly the same as when I walked in. I thought maybe it was the lighting, or my eyes, because she said it looked so much better than before. Usually when I don't like something I can say it right away, but this time I was simply at a loss for words. The girl was so nice! I'm an idiot for not saying SOMETHING. \\n\\nI was recommended two (expensive) products and was swiftly checked out and on my way, to the tune of $185(!) with tip. By the way, both products are garbage. \\n\\nNot one person noticed I got my hair done. NOT ONE. And the people that did know I was getting my hair done all said \\\"It looks exactly the same\\\", so I guess it wasn't just me. I still have golden highlights with my ashy (real) roots. Actually, the one (yes, one) new highlight I can see is my brassiest one. It's like the color you get from at-home bleaching...ugh. and of course it's at the front of my head so I have to hide it by being crafty with my part.\\n\\nI will not be returning and am going to a different salon in hopes of getting bright blonde color I've had before... Bummed :(\n",

Their mezze, an assortment of appetizers, seemed outrageously overpriced at $24, so we ordered baba ghannou, roasted eggplant with lemon juice and garlic dip served with warm pita triangles.  It was good, but I thought the addition of olive oil detracted from the taste and texture.  My wife's entre was kafta kabob, minced lamb with chopped onion and spices and served with tziki sauce while I ordered lamb kabob.  The kafta kabob was too light on the spices.  I ordered the lamb kabob medium rare and it ended up being both fatty and overcooked.  Our entrees were accompanied by rice and a bland salad.\n",

      "Review :  While the title might be better suited for a Manhattan Chelsea night club, the allure of Jody Maroni's is an easy one here at Sky Harbor - everyone hates the typical airport food options but most folks (even vegans) love hot dogs.\\n\\nBut these hot dogs aren't even worthy of a Joey Chestnut or Kobayashi throw down. They often remind me of a layman's version of a Costco dog but cost nearly 4x as much. Sad to say I've eaten here more times than I'd like to admit, but there isn't a single dog I can recommend on the menu.\\n\\nI can however, digress somewhat on my experiences here, all of which included slow and lackadaisical service and were driven by the hope that each time would be better. I've had their chicken andouille dog, which was really just an overcooked hot dog served in a semi-toasted bun. Now substitute the chicken andouille with their bratwurst, polish dog, Louisiana boudin hot link, chicken apple, Chicago style dog, sweet Italian and you have the same result.\\n\\nThe biggest offender was their priciest option, the kobe beef dog, supposedly made of wagyu, the red meat from heaven, a gift from carnivore gods. Yet, even at $9 (airport prices, yikes) it still tasted like ... just a Costco hot dog. Perhaps a tad juicier and an interesting snap to the casing but nothing mind blowing or back breaking but certainly wallet killing.\\n\\nIn the end, I mean Jodi Maroni no harm. After all, I've had a much more decent version of his hot dogs in other cities, but a little airport kiosk in a space full of commuters who are willing to pay the extra buck for (as Bourdain would coin it) \\\"meat in tube form\\\" nourishment, is not going to be making anything revolutionary anytime soon.\n",

I've had cupcakes at the Venetian and they were okay. So maybe this place had a bad day? \\n\\nThe place is cute. The cupcakes are adorable globs of sweet. They over-frost, as everyone says, but then the sprinkle it with either raw sugar, choco chips, or sprinkles and then there's another decoration on top of that, such as a flower, or a cookie. Very cute! \\n\\nNow, I'm not a cupcake connoisseur. You'd never think so from reading my reviews, but I love to buy cupcakes, I don't like to eat them. Does that make any sense? So, in my case, Gigi's is the perfect store for me, because the cupcakes LOOK gorgeous but they taste awful. \\n\\nCan you imagine putting plaster in your mouth? Then can you imagine adding a ton of sugar to that plaster? That pretty much sums up the flavor of ALL the cupcakes. It didn't matter if it was Citrus Green Tea (ha, don't make me laugh) or Blackberry surprise, it all tasted the same, gummy and over-sweet. There is no other flavor, but the colors of the cupcake are different. Maybe that's why they have different names, it's to describe the color of their cupcakes? \\n\\nThe only one that tasted barely ok and had any flavor was the oreo cookie, I did get hints of cookie and cream flavor. \\n\\nThe cakes were really stale and dry.

Took over an hour to get a car, and that does not include the time we spent waiting at Honda for them to pick us up. When we returned the car, they made us take it back to the Enterprise location instead of just leaving it at the car dealership, like happens at most places. And, yes, you guessed it, we had to wait over an hour at Enterprise to get back to the dealership. My Dad was not very happy, believe me!  And then, they tried to charge him for the rental because Showcase's accounting department would not pay for it. As a result, Enterprise would not return the deposit to my Dad. Finally, he called Enterprise's corporate office and had the regional manager call him, who got the deposit refunded and apologized for the hassle. Would have given them at least three stars, but he also went through a hassle getting his deposit back from the Enterprise at BIll Luke Chrysler as well. (2425 W Camelback, could not find a location for Enterprise with that address).\n",

I sat down and ordered the Strawberry Waffle and bacon, my husband ordered the chopped Steak and eggs... My SO-Called strawberry waffle came with NO strawberries and the bacon was thin as paper. I asked where my strawberries were to put on the top of my waffle and she said they were inside my waffle... MY WAFFLE LOOKED LIKE A BIG STRAWBERRY EGGO BUT FLATTER THAN A PANCAKE. To top it off my Husband got his SO-called chop steak and eggs...LMAO they brought him a fried HAMBURGER Patty dripping in grease! Sent it back, left and went to mcdonalds....

      "Review :  As much as I loved the food , the service was just so awful that I have to rate this 2 stars. The food was absolutely amazing :) I came here with a friend on 6/17/14 at 2 o'clock. We ordered our food and the two people up front just looked so miserable and unhappy. They acted like they were so busy too. There were very few people in the restaurant.  My friend and I both got wraps. Hers came out really quick. One of the girls then asked if everything was fine and we noted that I just needed my food. She then came back out with a salad. The salad was for somebody else. After waiting another 15 minutes , my food finally came out. I literally waited 28 minutes for a wrap while my friend had hers out in less than 10. I then asked for a side of ranch and that took another 5 minutes.  I was so frustrated and hungry that I actually went up to the kitchen and had to ask for the ranch. It's like they forgot about my order completely ! They didn't apologize once for their mistakes. The food was great, I was extremely pleased. Hopefully,  they work on their service some more however.\n",

      "Review :  This was the first time for me visiting this establishment.  It was busy because of the Transiberian Orchestra concert but there was not a wait to be seated. The first thing I did when I walked in was order a drink.  Stella Atrois $6.15 per draft.  Its a bit expensive, but being downtown and directly across from the Console Energy Center, I expected drinks to be a little on the expensive side.  \\n\\nAfter I was seated with my party, we were served bottles of water at the table.  I suspect tap water in reusable glass bottles.  After, it took quite a bit for our waitress to come back to take our order. My girlfriend and I started with the Poutine Appetizer.  Again, it took a long time for our food to arrive.  The app was pretty good, but for french fries, cheese and gravy, $10 was a bit on the expensive side.  But again, downtown restaurant so it was expected.  My girlfriend also ordered a glass of white wine.  It was served in a soaking wet glass.  And when she commented on that to the waitress and asked for a different glass, the waitress almost seemed annoyed. \\n\\nFor dinner, I ordered the Hangover Cure Sandwich with blue cheese, garlic fries.  My girlfriend had the crab cake entree.  It took almost 45 minutes for our entrees to arrive.  There were two crab cakes about the size of a hockey puck each  (no pun intended) and the cost was $27.  This time, I expected a little but more in the portion department for $27.  When my entree arrived, everything looked great but the waitress forgot my side of ranch dressing.  She then looked at me and said \\\"oh, I forgot your ranch dressing, Ill be right back with that\\\".  Needless to say, she never brought it.  It also took forever for her to bring our check, pick them up, and return them.  It almost made my friends late for the concert.  At this point, the restaurant was dead, so being busy had nothing to do with the time it took our waitress to do her job.\\n\\nAll in all, I would not suggest this place.  There are a lot of other restaurants downtown (and just across the river on the south side) that are a lot better bang for your buck and a lot better service.  I will not be going back.\n",

The food is always cold, the sides are terrible (except for the coleslaw), and the service is terrible - whenever I have gone it is like a bunch of high schoolers are running the place.  Last time I went half the tables weren't cleared,  there was no cutlery to eat with and I had to ask for it 6 times and wait 5 minutes to get anything, and after I did I had a door slammed in my face.

      "Review :  It's probably been 8 years since we last tried out the Garden Court Buffet.  We had fond memories of it from previous visits.  I don't know what has happened, but our breakfast buffet was extremely disappointing.  It's one of the most inexpensive breakfast buffets you will find in Las Vegas.  It's only $8.  But even for that price, we wouldn't go back again.\\n\\nThe coffee was the worst we've ever had.  It was served in plastic mugs and was very watery.  I could barely drink it.  The orange juice was almost as bad.  We tried a variety of items.  We were disappointed with everything except the omelet, coconut donut, and cinnamon rolls.\\n\\nWe arrived around 8:30 am on a weekday morning in early April and there was no line.  When we left around 9:30, there was still no line.  So, I think it's safe to say you won't have to wait to get into this breakfast buffet.\\n\\nConclusion:  If you have very low expectations, you might not be disappointed by this breakfast buffet.  For the same price, we found the breakfast buffet at the Orleans to be better.  Of all the buffets we went to during our 5-day stay, this was by far the worst.  If you want an absolutely scrumptious dining experience, you must try the breakfast buffet at the Wynn or the Wicked Spoon.\n",

But I have to give this place a pass. \\n\\nI ordered an Italian sausage and mushroom pie from these guys not too long after they opened.... and it was a big disappointment. The crust was not too bad: nice and chewy, but could have been cooked a few minutes longer. It's the toppings that were a complete trainwreck. The Italian sausage were the same nasty, commercial \\\"pellets\\\" you'd get on a Little Caesar's pizza, and the sauce tasted like it came straight from a can. They were a bit too light on the cheese, too. But the worst thing was that the pizza wasn't cooked enough, and the toppings wanted to slide off the slices! When I tired pulling my first slice off the pie, I got a piece of bread with tomato sauce and a pile of toppings in the box! After carefully removing the second slice, I went to eat it and all the toppings slid off and landed on my plate!\\n\\nDomino's and Pizza Hut might make mediocre pies, but they have it down to a science and both charge reasonable money for their products.I'd LOVE IT if Joe's was a success. But why should I pay $14+ for a disappointing pie when I can get something demonstrably better from Pizza Hut for $10?\n",

After our awful experience here, I just had to sign up on yelp and tell everyone my our experience (do not disregard because I am new to giving my opinion on yelp).\\nWe had no reservations but that doesn't mean you have to give us such a bad attitude when we asked for a table?  Yet, I think they gave us the worst table because we had no reservations?  Literally 2 mins after we were seated, they seated 2 older men right next to us and we might as well been a table of 4!  They were so close and so loud that we were part of their conversation.  How romantic.  The places wasn't even full and there were empty tables!\\nNice selection of fresh made pasta...\\nBut I ended up ordering a dish from their regular menu, Red Linguine Portifino with shrimps and scallops.  The sauce just ok and wasn't even that spicy. And what scallops?  There were barely any in the dish.  And the shrimps...are you kidding me?  They were tiny and with the full tail on which was like half the shrimp because they were so small.  I've been to many fancy italians restaurants and when I order an expensive past dish, I expect not to spend most my time picking the tail off with my knife and fork.  What a pain.  Funny thing is, then loud man sitting next to us order the same dish.  Instead of using his fork and knife, he simply put the whole shrimp in his mouth and used his fingers to pull the tail out.  How classy!!  \\nI almost forgot to add, it was nice one of the chef's walked around and said hello and asked how everything was but if you are going to do that, why exclude CERTAIN tables?

Called in to place my order with an Ashley, she asks for my number which I give her two times to confirm and tell her to have the driver call me so I can come down stairs and open the door due to no doorbell at my location I was at. She tells me no problem I will have the driver call. Remind you I am ordering for 6 hungry men that have had a long day to begin with. So one hour goes by and I call to get an ETA on the order and Ashley tells me the driver had been to my location and he was knocking and calling but I must have been to busy to hear my phone or door knocks. I said that's weird I did not miss a call nor am I to busy right now so she said she will call the driver and have him come right back. I then asked her to make sure for the third time she had the right number and confirmed it again with her. I waited another 15 mins and nothing, so I call back a third time, and get a different employee. I tell her what happened and she places me on hold and puts me on with a manager, he tells me the same thing Ashley told me about the driver knocking and calling multiple times and he should be there any second. 10 mins later the driver shows up with me waiting outside at this point so I don't miss him and as soon as he pulls up I say I'm so sorry I didn't hear you knock, then the driver tells me he NEVER knocked he called the number printed on the ticket, I ask him what number it was, and it was a wrong number they printed. So my problem here is the simple fact two people lied to me and told me the driver knocked on my door, and they were confirming my number which they had the right one which they didn't.

      "Review :  I have been to a lot of restaraunts and worked in the hospitality industry for over 18 years and I can clearly state \\\"THIS IS THE NASTIEST PLACE I HAVE EVER BEEN TO.\\\"  Right from the get go, the smell here is horrific.  Why did I not turn around right then you ask???? Great question,,, I am going to say that the stench is so overwhelming it puts you into a mild coma and you are not able to clearly function or think straight.  That caused me to to stay.  I was also having not such a good morning so I just gave in and figured something to eat would help.  I ordered a polish sausuage sandwich on sourdough.  Let's just say that the cup of mustard that was on this aboration was too much to handle.  I brought it up to the server who could care less excetp to say \\\"Yeah, that's a lot of mustard\\\".  That was his solution.  \\n\\nSo in a nutshell:\\n1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.\\n2) The food cannot really be called that.  The slop they serve is litterally unedible.  \\n3) The service staff has ZERO clue what service is and how to take care of anyone.  \\n\\nThis place should honestly be blown up.  What a pit of despair.\n",

      "Review :  I've eaten a lot of bbq to separate the good and the worst and Big Erns is definitely in the bottom of the list. \\nBefore i do the cons I'll tell you the pros on my visit. \\nI just enjoyed the Brisket.. \\nCons...\\nFirst and foremost, let's review the ribs... they were not moist and very chewy. There was only 4 pcs and I gave up on the 3rd one. A BBQ joint should always have good ribs.\\nSecond the pulled pork. That pork was so dry and chewy also; even L&L hawaiian bbq does a better job at it even at late hours!. The sauce is not evenly spread out. \\nA BBQ joint should have a good sauce and yes the sauce was good considering they only had one flavor that's comparable to the ones I buy at albertsons. \\nNext I had the pork and beans...i don't know why the people next to me was saying it's good when it clearly taste like the ones I use to buy at walmart. No special taste there. To be honest I use to buy it as dog food. \\nAlso did the Potato salad....that was horrible even my kid pointed out it was bad. I also had him try the cup of water telling him it's refreshing. He's reaction?? x[ like that. lol and last the dinner roll. Smh.. \\n\\nFor the price I'd recommend going to Famous Daves. They have a variety of sauces and the quality is always consistent.  I don't know if I went to Big Erns late but 5 pm there was still lots of people so there shouldn't be an excuse to serve it like that. \\nAlso people should not always believe on over hyped places. Don't believe it till you try it cause most often it mind f***s u and u start to believe it's good. Believe in your taste buds ;)\n",

I got steak which I asked for medium rare and it was cooked well the steak was pretty chewy. My companion had some pasta dish that wasn't so good. \\n\\nSo overall, price was about the only thing that was good.

Our waitress was rude from beginning, she only made eye contact with the men at the table and even neglected to enter one of our orders. Three dinner entrees arrived 25 minutes later when we had ordered dinners for four. The fourth entree was delivered to our table about another 20 minutes later after everyone else had already finished their meals. The waitress failed to apologize and the manager gave a subpar apology. The food quality was not worth the wait or the horrible service.

Now AIX is gone, and the food, when it eventually comes, looks better than it tastes, UNLESS you like really rich food. Like really rich. As in a thick white truffle cappuccino and a butter-like fois gras. The combination of tastes on the plate is...odd. I can understand, for example, the theory behind mixing the fatty salmon tartar with acidic apple, but, well, it doesn't work. The fois gras plate was equally challenged. The worst was their Christmas yuletide log chocolate dessert, which was essentially a stale Twinkie...\\n\\nOn the bright side, the decor and service was very good (apart from the slow, slow kitchen).

Last Thursday afternoon a bus full of travelers, many Gold got off the bus to find their name not on the Gold sign, so more than  half a dozen of us lined up outside (gold office too small for more than 3-4 people) to wait for ONE person to find us cars.  Finally after 20 mins a second person came to help  After a significant wait I was asked if I really needed a full-sized car as requested.  Since it was apparent something else would be quicker I took what they offered (of course smaller not more luxurious). The car was fine - however, the return experience on Friday afternoon was just as miserable - perhaps more so since I was now running late for my flight. \\n\\nFirst of all, CLT airport you need a traffic light at the intersection Near the  Hertz return entrance - it took about 15 mins to get across the street -thankfully and airport official car coincidentally came by and let cars that needed to go straight into the lot cross. \\n\\nAnd then, we waited another 15 mins for a bus to take us to the terminal - bad planning Hertz.

On top of that there is bird poop on the front window, along with the poop I don't think they cleaned the inside windows at all.

My mouth was greeted by a small, but overwhelmingly crucial detail....they used salted butter. Not just lightly salted butter....this was REALLY salty butter. I quickly try to scrape as much butter off the pancake, but alas, it had mostly already soaked into the waffle. Even after pouring more than a comfortable amount of maple syrup onto the waffle it was so salty. I tried to move on to the bacon instead and then I really got upset. THEY SALTED THE BACON TOO!!!!

Also, despite the size of the place, it's somewhat cramped and airless by all the machines, tables, and people crammed inside (and searching for a door...).\\n\\nHOTEL...\\nSlowest.  Check in.  Ever.  The desk had a full complement of staff, but each employee across the board was taking 10-15 minutes per customer.  I wondered if this might just be overkill on customer service, or maybe even slow computers (I was ready to give benefit of the doubt), until my turn at the front of my line when I discovered that no, it was just slow staff.\\n\\nEach floor of the hotel is beautiful and airy, especially the central area near the elevators from which the spokes of the hallways radiate.  The rooms are . . . okay.  They're rooms.  Simple, but nicely decorated.  The pictures on the walls are nicely framed black & white photos of stars of stage and screen.  (Some are a bit dark and creepy, but most are nice.)  But the feel is _old_.  The fixtures are not ageing well, from chipped, scarred, and stained chairs, to chipped, scarred, and stained bathroom fixtures.  (I was a little concerned about the toilet.)  The beds are beautiful and supremely comfortable, but otherwise I definitely felt let down by the quality -- I just expected much more.  Plus, for a non-smoking floor, there was a constant definite smell of cigarette smoke in my room.\\n\\nOverall does the job as a hotel, but the old-school Tinseltown elegance has definitely faded.  With all the other options around, I won't stay here again.\n",

The server springs on us that he can only accept two credit cards.  That was VERY inconvenient especially since he didn't tell us until we were paying.  Like I said, we were 9 people and were pretty much the only people there during their lunch hour.  I was surprised they were not more accomodating.  Although we all enjoyed our food for the most part, we all decided we would not return.\n",

The waitress took forever and did not give a rat's a** that she did.  We all ordered the Choice Cut Ribeye Steak.  Huge mistake!  I got the teriyaki style and my cousin and husband got the cowboy broiled steaks.  You could definitely tell these were cheap steaks.  I mean seriously cheap like found dead on the road or something.  Terrible, terrible tasting!  And what teriyaki sauce??  I mean can't they just get it from the jar?  Ugh seriously one of the worst steaks we have ever tasted.  The baked potatao was bleh and the green beans were soft and mushy.  I guess I should have known when I seen the sour cream come in a packet.  I gave this place one star for the beer.  I got the High Roller Gold which was pretty good.\n",

So I decided to try HH to see what's its all about, nothing fancy. I arrived around 6:30 pm to plenty of space at the bar, so I sat quickly.

I opted for a bowl of shrimp fried rice and side salad, mom ordered the Sea Bass. After quietly waiting 20 mins with no second  beverage, I made note to one of the bartenders about our drinks. By 7:40 no food and no drinks. I watched 3 people behind the bar make drinks and clean. Where in the heck are my drinks?! When inquiring about the food, we were advised that it was almost done (someone told me that 15 mins ago). Now I'm hungry and thirsty. What makes it bad is that I ordered the drinks TWICE! At this point we're ready to go, so we ask for the food as such. 10 mins later the food arrives...Plated. I THOUGHT I ASKED FOR THIS TO GO! Why is it so difficult to get good service?\\n\\nBenihana is hit or miss these days. More miss than hit.\n",

We ended up at a pretty nice table though and the waiter came over right away. However, the very little english he spoke was barely understood as he whispered his way though his introduction. The drink order ended up being 2 glasses of white wine, a glass of red wine and a beer. 15 minutes later, he came with 3 glasses of white wine. Um...\\nWe corrected him and he got us the right drinks and took our food orders. I ordered the pork chop and strongly emphasized my desire to have it very well done. All the while straining to hear his broken english. \\nThe food came, my pork was pink throughout. My fiance's steak was rare (he asked for medium) and his father's gravy was that out of a McCormick's dry seasoning package from the grocery store. I sent back the pork to have it cooked further and they, kindly enough, took it off the check because the waiter was clearly in the wrong. There was this \\\"apple chutney\\\" on the chop and anyone could've given me a side of canned apples with cinnamon flavoring and I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference. The mashed potatoes were cold and had questionable chucks in it, that I really don't think were just un-mashed potato and the asparagus tasted like dirt. \\nThey gave us a free appetizer coupon because of the trouble, which was also a nice gesture but to be completely honest, I don't know that we'll ever go back there. Maybe just to drink and as long the person waiting on us knows the difference between red and white wine. We'll wait til they start washing their veggies before we ever eat there again though....\n",

      "Review :  This review is for the customer service and management. I purchase a yelp deal ($10 for $15) and the manager or owner basically did everything possible to stop me from using the deal. We first arrived on a sunday morning, and after showing our yelp deal, the owner claimed the deal was only valid on weekdays. No where on the details of the deal does it state that the deal would only be applicable on weekdays, however, I still decided to give it a try. We asked the waitress what else we needed to know about the deal and she said as long as we came in on a weekday, we would be able to show the deal and use it. The second time we came back, the waitress claimed we couldn't use the deal because we didn't print out the offer......ok, no where on the deal does it state we have to print this offer, it says to show them the redemption code (as with all other yelp deals). We asked to speak to the manager and the waitress came back saying \\\"oh he's busy right now.\\\" We asked if we could wait because we're from LA so we don't have every opportunity to come out here. She came back saying \\\"he says you cannot use the deal. There's nothing I can do about this...\\\" we turn around and clearly see the manager just standing in the kitchen not doing anything. We asked one more time if we could speak to him and she came back and said \\\"he's too busy to talk to you, you cannot use the deal...\\\" Honestly, he couldn't even come out and tell us himself? He had to pretend he was \\\"busy\\\" and send her saying the same thing each time. WORST customer service ever - it's not even about the deal, the fact is he couldn't event take 2 minutes of his time to come talk to a customer. If they really dont want you to use the deal - why offer one? Obviously, the deal is no longer on yelp. I will never return, and I highly advise you do the same as the food was nothing to rage about and customer service seems to be  non existent.\n",

No. Design and Wine just doesn't know how to do it right. First of all, rather than spending a little more on a higher qualify plate, they utilize cheap styrofoam plates as a palette, so the paint slides all over the place. Secondly, they break Nevada State Law because they obviously purchase their boxed wine from SAMs or Costco when they should be getting their alcohol from a distributor. Why support a business that can't even follow a simple law? The atmosphere was incredibly boring and the owner, Rachel, was seemingly nowhere to be found. Likewise, her staff looked incredibly misersble- not use to that since i only saw smiles on the faces of Wine and Canvas employees. Word to the wise- spend your money elsewhere. Zero stars given.

We got to the hostess and asked to be seated outside. We were notified quickly that a table was open, the table right next to the entrance without a view that obviously no one wanted. I'm not sure if this was because we are locals, we were ordering from Restaurant Week menu, or that was really the last and ONLY table. This process had already taken longer than necessary so we did not fight it. Since we knew what we wanted we ordered immediately, the mixed berry smoothie, cinnamon bun hot chocolate french toast, and the hangover omelette. We waited for around 20 minutes to get our smoothies and another 45 to get our meals. The omelette was luke-warm in the middle and the french toast was good but soggy. The waitress was EXTREMELY nice and noticed we weren't pleased, she offered to take it back and was super apologetic(I wish I remembered her name).

Order was from last night.\\nI'm pasting the comment that I sent to PJ on their website below:\\n\\nOrdered a pick up online. 2 mediterranean chicken pitas (1 no onion) and a kids meal. There were 3 issues with my order. My husband went to pick up the order and he was charged for a large soda. He was surprised by this because I don't buy us sodas, he even questioned the cashier and she said \\\"yes, there is a large soda on this order\\\". WRONG. No large soda was ordered, you all owe me $3.00. 2nd problem, both pitas had onion. Your onions are very strong and they upset my stomach. I picked all the onions out of my pita but could still taste them. Husband is complaining that his stomach hurts from his onions, not your fault, I told him \\\"I told you so\\\"... but in regards to my pita, fail. 3rd issue my kids meal fruit was put in the clamshell with 4 HOT items: steamed broccoli, chicken and mac-n-cheese. Who puts fruit in with hot food?

The food here is substandard 'Mexican' that tastes extremely salty and is loaded with sodium, calories, and fat (their fish tacos have over 1800 calories... whoa). Their portions are outrageously large. Don't bother looking at their nutritional facts, it will make you sad.... And yes, I get it , Americanized Mexican food is generally bad for you, but at least it tastes good at other restaurants. To their credit, they do have a 'healthy' menu that lists the calories, unfortunately this food is also not very good. On my most recent visit, I got the 'healthy' combo with an enchilada and fajita taco with a side of grilled veg. The veg was fine, the taco tasted like they dumped a bunch of that lime juice that comes in the green bottle all over some prepackaged precooked chicken slices... not awesome, but made better by adding some of the grilled veg and some salsa to it. The enchilada was also nothing special, but not terrible. The husband's enchiladas were a 'salt lick.' A family member ordered the guac, which they made table side. I don't even know how they could make fresh guac so flavorless. I would not recommend on the border to anyone and am keeping my fingers crossed that I will not have to make a return visit.\n",

      "Review :  It is clear that this restaurant knows nothing about service.   The young servers just stand and gossip while their tables, presumably, rot.  You sit at the sushi bar and they bring you your menu, bring you ONE drink and disappear for the rest of the night-no plate pick-up or drink reorders. As for the chefs, one is good, but the others are so SLOW at making their rolls.  They need to learn to alternate between sushi bar customers so everyone has at least one roll to eat while they begin at the top again...you know? At present, it is often that each whole party gets All of their rolls before another party gets even one. So if all the seats are taken at the bar, at least one set of guests won't get one morsel for a half-hour. And then you will get all of it at once. If service is important, forget this restaurant.  But the food is delicious, so it has to be braved once in a while.\n",

      "Review :  The fair is kind of cool because it always takes me back to being a kid. Not specially this fair since I am from Ohio, but the generalized idea of \\\"the fair\\\". The Arizona State fair typically has at least a few descent concerts that I added each year, a lot of rides (which I do not ride), and a lot of games. But there are also a lot of challenges, and perhaps it is partially because of the age of the fair and the growth of the neighborhood around it. First, parking is challenging. Actually not so much the parking, because I usually have no problem parking on the lot for $10, but getting to the parking is the issue. The traffic is very congested there and it makes getting to the fair a negative experience. There are throngs of people crossing the street which delay the turning cars, and they in turn block the street so the cars diving toward the fair cannot proceed. \\n\\nAnother issue is ticketing. It is the 21st century and you would think there would have been some advances in ticketing. But no. Come on a Friday evening and be prepared to wait a long time to get a ticket because there are hundreds of people and only six ticket booths. How about installing some automated ticket booths like the movie theaters? \\n\\nI like the concerts, but I am always confused. Do I pay for the concert AND the fair? Typically that is what I have been doing, but last week as I was hoping to go to a concert and the long ticket line caused me to not get through until 7:15 there were fair representatives telling people if they had their concert ticket they could just go in the back gate without buying fair admission. I also heard that there are free general admission seats to the concerts if you have a fair ticket. I attempted that this Friday and unfortunately did not get in because the general admission was already full.\\n\\nTraffic issues are not limited to the street. Friday evening walking down one of the main paths in the fair everything came to a standstill. The path had food booths on both sides so people standing in line at those vendors extended into the path, and there were so many people coming in both directions that it turned into a mass area of people just standing and unable to move for more than five minutes. As we were able to slowly eventually shuffle it moved better once we passed the food booths. \\n\\nI still like the thought of the fair, even though it is an expensive evening with the food and games. But the parking, the ticketing, and the number of people in an area that is too narrow makes it an experience I can only tolerate once or maybe twice per year. The fair cannot address the issues of the street traffic, but adding improved ticketing and spreading out the items inside the fairgrounds would help.\n",

      "Review :  I had a terrible customer experience at this location today which is franchise owned by a lady named Pam and her husband.  I went in to order a drink that I had ordered two days prior from the same store.  The lady who took my order was Pam.  She said she could not fill my order because she was told to stay away from special orders.  I asked if I could speak with the manager and she acted like she did not hear me.  After going back and forth I decided to order the Veggie Delight minus ginger.  Another cashier by the name of Gabriela came to the front to take my order, Pam was rude, pointed at me and said I don't know what she wants.  There was about 5 people behind me in line, so I placed my order and stood at the pick up counter.  They fixed my juice last and put ginger in my juice even though I requested none.  I asked who was the manager, and they gave me a name Dom.  Five minutes later another girl came from the back to refund my order.  I asked again who was the manager and she said she was.  I asked who was the owner and she said Pam and her husband.  I proceeded to tell her about the poor customer service.  She never apologized or offered to fix my drink.

I'm like, yo I thought the menu said bacon infused pancakes b!?  I didn't see no bacon bits creatively infused into the pancake son, matter of fact, I'm glad I didn't complain off top!  Because they did have bacon in the pancakes but it was one whole piece per pancake like as if they cooked one side, waited 3 minutes, threw a piece of bacon on it, flipped it, then cooked it another 3 minutes.

I'm 26 years old fam!  You can't give me the baby scoop with the adult main event son.  I ate that shit in one bite and had nothin' else to off set the adobo flavor.  But yo, I ain't even tryna play this place son, because I saw some other shit on the menu that was probably way better than what I got.  I'm also Filipino, so grabbin' some Filipino food probably wasn't the best idea because my moms be makin' that shit since I was 3 yo, so I'm not really impressed by it nahmean?

I had not eaten at his (or any other location) in at least a year, but this place is not as good as it once was.\\n\\nThey used to bring out great soft warm fresh bread.  The 3 loaves of bread they brought out for our group of 8 were all charred.  A co-worker got the canneloni - it looked good until she took a couple of bites of one of the two pieces and it was cold in the middle.  It was like it had been refrigerated or frozen and just reheated :(  I can do better than that by getting frozen pasta at Sam's Club and for a whole cheaper.  They brought it back but all they did was dump a lot of warm sauce on it so it was still cold in the middle.  Another coworker ordered chicken with her pasta (which all of us heard) and they did not put it on. A small lunch salad now costs an extra $2.50 when served with an entree when not that long ago it was $1.  I understand the need to raise prices due to food costs, but this is mostly lettuce here, plus it's also an add-on. Our waitress was nice, but we were there for 90 minutes and our waters were refilled only once.  They also added on 18% for mediocre service so that was another disappointment.\\n\\nThere were a couple of positives.  My tortellini with chicken and Gorgonzola was pretty tasty, as were my coworkers' pizza and grilled chicken salad.  They gave my co-worker a surprise tiramisu because they felt bad about her canneloni.  Unfortunately, she doesn't like the taste of coffee, so she didn't eat it.    The overall experience was definitely \\\"meh\\\" so it will likely be a while before I give it another shot.

The eating area is dark and unwelcoming, both times I went the woman behind the counter was extremely unfriendly,  the prices are way to high even for Mill and to top it off, the food sucks. Also, no one working there seemed to care about the fly that was buzzing around  the open food containers, helping himself to a free lunch. No one except me.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not a snob, I eat at crusty looking establishments and as long as the food is good and the place appears to be marginally clean I am a happy camper!

      "Review :  Had high hopes for this place. My bf and I finally were able to go out kid free, and decided to treat ourselves. The place was cozy inside and we were greeted and told the wait was over an hour. The bar was full and  so the hostess took our phone number and we went next door for a drink to wait for our table. When we came back we were seated and we waited about 10 minutes before we were greeted. About 10 more minutes came by before we got our drinks and we got to order our food. I tried to order a few items on the menu but mostly everything was sold out. We ordered the sampler, which was ok, the meats seemed like they were left on the grill and forgot about and thrown onto the plate. No seasonings, poorly executed presentation. I got the duck that was so overcooked I couldn't even squeeze out any moisture from it, the saut\\u00e9ed spinach had potential to be good but it had way too much garlic, and was just poorly made. My bf ordered the basa fish which was lovely, but unfortunately I was so discouraged to order another item off their menu because I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for something else that would've been disappointing. I really wanted to like this place, even after the server took off the price of the duck, we didn't have a manager come over to talk to us. I was heart broken that our once every 3 month date night was a huge let down. My bf emailed trophys and no one ever responded. Please don't waste your money or time here unless you want to be disappointed.\n",

But this third time was just uuggghh. I try to be an understanding customer and not lash out at waitresses because usually if the food is crap, it's not their fault but I gave these two waitresses my first lashing because they let me sit there and boil for twenty minutes as I waited for them. \\n\\nThe experience (setting: there were only 5 other occupied tables and no one came in after us):\\n1) it was15 minutes after we were seated before we got water. We had to ask for it. Our glasses were never refilled.. Esp since they didn't come by until I called for them.\\n2) there were 4 of us. we had to ask for another utensil setting since table only had 3. \\n3) food took 10 minutes to partially come out. We had to ask for our miso soup since they forgot or didn't know our lunch came with it. Waitress told us that our two cali rolls would take a little bit. Those did not come out til 30 min later. \\n4) food was beyond poor. My teriyaki salmon didn't have a teriyaki glaze. Seemed like it was just deep fried. Hard - overcooked. My dads teriyaki salmon was   still raw in the inside. My moms bulgogi was flavorless and cold and galbi was hard and not marinated. My bfs tofu soup (soondubu) tasted Ok but not traditional flavor or what I'm used to. Wasn't even red. Daeji bulgogi was Ok. Lastly, the Cali roll was ugh. The rice around the roll just didn't taste right. The insides were standard.\\n\\nI asked if there was a new chef or something and she just responded, we are a bit unorganized today.

I felt like that was unfair, very, very unfair.  Plus, I thought that was really unhygienic of her to handle cash in the middle of cleaning and polishing my niece's nails.

Standing at the register for more 20 minutes or so without any update of what the hell is going on. When the return/exchange was almost complete he said he couldn't credit back the remaining balance, so I had to look for something close to the balance account. When I told him I needed time to look around and decide he just gave me a look and a sigh of being annoyed. Well, sorry to be such a nuisance mister. But I AM a paying customer you know. He could've said those terms while I was standing there for 20 mins doing nothing. Not going back here ever again.\n",

Everything since then, including spending hours on the phone following up on a referral, false promises to send to referral dr.s and finally a decision Dr Lersch would not support a referral to a speech therapist even though he diagnosed him as tongue tied.

      "Review :  With the money spent on the new Cosmopolitan, I expected nothing by unique and greatness from their hip named Wicked Spoon Buffet.\\nTo set the mood.......Dissapointment\\nI am a foodie! Trained chef yada yada yada. I love great food and dont mind paying for it.\\nFirst is the decieving waiting line. Its not the real line, its just the line to pay and then go stand in line, wait time at lunch about 40 minutes, play on your smartphone.\\nNow the food. Their niche apparently is to serve most everthing in cute little one portion varying vesself from porcelain cups, plastic cups, little metal pots, skewers etc. But they give you at best a 8inch square plate to put these 5 inche round cupped servings = you can only get about three of these tapas sized portions on the plate and are forced to put not cupped item around the cups and touching the sides. The whole thing weighs about 4 lbs on your way back to the table and contains about 8 ounces of food. The shrimp items were delicious and actually tasted like shrimp and you did not have to peel the shells. Very few vegetables. I repeat very few. All of the fish was set out in this portion concept and I nearly choked from their dryness and overcooked status. Pizza right out of the wood fired oven is great, but when it sits out one lonlely slice under heat lamps you get it, dried out. The good. Salads were excellent and unusual, great little shrimp cocktails, mashed potatoes, sake turkey roast, hand carved country bacon, sushi very plain but decent, lots of food turnover on popular items, but the not so popular items sit, and sit.\\nDesert area is very unique with some real memorable items like giant white and dark covered strawberries that would go for about $3 each outside of the buffet. Good cookies, but seriously are you going to this buffet for cookies? I did not try the dim sum, or any of the breads. The stinger is the buffet cost about $24 including one alcoholic beverage that you cannot opt out of. While the concept is unique and you will probably not see another display of foods in this format, your appreciation of quality fine food will not permit you to return. In summary, novel concept, expensive for what you get, food choices limited compared to other Vegas fine buffets, and fairly long wait time. Too many trips of heavy plates full of tiny portions for $24 and I didnt want the Bloody Mary. Since a Bloody Mary the same size in one of their bars cost $12 the buffet would be worth $12.\\nParis, is superior food for about 30% less money.\n",

Ok, so I took one of my friend on vacation from New York along the adventure with me to this place in one of the 'your suicidal if youre out on this cold' night. Freezing out only added in my to determination to get my hands on some great poutine. I walked in and the unfriendly staff could not have made my visit colder then the weather outside. When they took the order the people kept rushing as if we were unwelcome. We sat and waited only to get stale pizzas. And the poutine that I was looking so forward to could not even beat Burger King's 4.79 + tax. After seeing and tasting the food even I wanted to get out of the place as fast as the staff seemed like they wanted us out of there.

      "Review :  Saturday / Sunday AYCE brunch\\n\\nIn true las vegas fashion, you get a flat rate to eat your heart out. \\n\\nFor Strip food, main menu items seem reasonably priced and the brunch is cheap at $29.99. There are a few different flavors to choose from for the All-You-Can-Drink Bottomless mimosas. They're $5 per person; but on multiple occasions, the $5 was comped for me and my dining partner. Maybe its a local discount? \\n\\nAt the beginning, you're served a plate of sliced fruit w/ a mango sauce and a plate of guava empanadas. Those empanadas are probably the best part of the menu! Not too sweet with the perfect crust and just a hint of cream cheese in the filling. After that I was a little under-enthused. The savory dishes start to taste the same after a while and the desserts are much too sweet. Their gimmick item is the Bacon Jalape\\u00f1o PBJ. Peanut butter, jelly, egg, bacon, and a couple slices of mild jalapeno on a biscuit. Worth a try. It is AYCE after all. \\n\\nYou would think a Top Chef Masters restaurant would be more impressive. And given that they've won Best Brunch awards from Seven, LVRJ, & LVW, I expected this place to knock my socks off! While I can't judge the main menu food, I can say the past two times I've done the brunch the food has been less than piping hot. I'm very particular about my food being served in a timely manner; not necessarily because I'm worried about F&B sanitation standards but rather I just enjoy eating scalding hot food. Most of the dishes are served with refried beans and some form of egg (poached, fried, or scrambled). When a restaurant uses so much of these filler ingredients, they have to keep in mind that one of the most common signs of a kitchen-to-table delay is congealed beans and cold yolks.\\n \\nDespite the food being a little blah, the service is top-notch. Everyone is really friendly and my champagne flute was always filled to the brim. Border Grill is an impressive dining facility. It's huge and able to suit anyone's seating preferences. There's your usual indoor dining, the indoor atrium, and outdoor on the patio. On the patio, you can people-watch the fancy Mandalay pool. But you'll have to deal with insects, the weather, and the sights of all those people who shouldn't be wearing speedos. My area of choice is the atrium. The high-ceilings and natural light make your dining experience that much more pleasurable.\n",

First off this is simply above a Carl Jr's sorry to say but it is, and you get served off of plastic plate, interior looks super hip and cool, but when your burger is brought out, it reminds me of going to a weekend BBQ gathering served by uncle Fred who has been drinking beers and cooking your burgers. \\n\\nWe ordered the NM Burger obviously residing in NM we thought heck lets give it a try, the condiments over killed the burger itself and the presentation was very juvenile and it made me feel like I said \\\"Uncle Fred\\\" made it....... the meat itself was pretty bland and quite small even for the low cost definitely not worth it. The price is good, but I would rather pay more to get a quality burger that is culinary inspired and using good quality condiments. \\n\\nThe staff was friendly and attentive but when asked what we thought, we replied okay, she said well you order a burger right, so that is what you got a \\\"Burger\\\" they all taste the same there is nothing to it. I would never want my staff to respond that way to a guest, but as I said this is a glorified Carl Jrs, sorry Bobby Flay I would definitely take my name off so that you dont ruin your reputation or get some better training for  your staff that represents YOU!!\n",

My husband and I are both active duty and we were staying in base lodging, but had to move here when there was no longer availability for us on base (were waiting to close on a house). When we called to make reservations, the women who we spoke to was pleasant enough. She had told us that there were utensils and other things provided for the kitchenette. We walked in and i swear i wanted to turn right back around. It reminded me of an 80s massacre movie/porn film. The \\\"kitchenette\\\" had a butter knife, 2 forks and 2 spoons and a few glasses. We went down to the front desk and they said they'd try to get something for us and we had a few pots delivered the next day. Needless to say we ended up buying a cutting board, some knives and other essentials for cooking a meal. Our refrigerator was broken and didn't work, luckily they came out and swapped it that same day. We also wanted them to check on our AC because i swear that thing is possessed. They came to \\\"look\\\" at it but said there was nothing they can do unless it stops working. It wakes us up every few hours with groans and pounding noises and screeches. Its not fun at all. The towels are a joke, if you want to call them towels. On the plus, the internet is pretty fast though. we were stuck with a room of 2 double beds. We thought one of the mattresses smelled of urine but nope, come to find out, there is an amazingly strong odor of urine just under the bed on the carpet! Yay! it smells so bad. The other double bed wasn't as bad..we only found one bug crawling in it so far. UGH! This place is not worth the money even with the sorry excuse for a military discount. I was considering moving into my coworkers RV instead of living here, but we are so tired of moving all our stuff around. Oh yeah- and the housekeeping only comes once a week- if you want it more often it costs extra..i think they said $40. NOT WORTH IT!

I LOVE my burgers and had hunted out the best on our trip. This was sadly the worst we had. Also it seemed strange that the burger listed along the lines of the ultimate bowl burger came without cheese or bacon for which you had to pay extra on the $16 or so price tag. If it's the deluxe venue burger pimp it up guys!\\n\\nTo top matters off my wife's chicken burger was made from chicken mince and not breast. She had one bite, said it was cold and didn't touch anymore. With such a cool venue, rock ethos, friendly staff and great beer menu we expected food to match - maybe a bad day in the kitchen but it sadly reminded us of cheap chain pub food in the uk - not fresh, lacking care and definitely a sad end to our beer and food tour that had so many highlights.\n",

      "Review :  We have been here plenty of times and keep coming back because of the food, one time our waitress dug her tiny shorts out of her ass and proceeded to serve us without washing her hands first. We made a comment to the owner she apologized but then we saw the cook cough all over our food. We went there today with our daughter, only a party of 2 was on the list ahead of us. Well once they were sat the hostess sat people that came in after us. When we questioned her about it she said that they only seat party of 3 at their ridiculously tiny tables. Which wouldn't be so bad if they didn't bring every item you order on its own plate. We weren't given an option of the bar or table. Which we would've picked the bar because there is more room and it was available first. They attempted to sit us at the baby table and sat a party of 3 white people at the bar. She was very friendly to the white costumers but not us. My money is green just like theirs. Will not be going back for a long time...please make the little girls that work there wear shorts that are longer than their vagina. Very unprofessional!\n",

      "Review :  Embarassed to say that we ate at this Rosati's every week the first year we were here until they closed a short time ago.  I even wrote corporate to see if they would reopen. Just imagine my glee when I found out they would be reopening!   That's where my joy ends.  We ordered the exact same thing we've been ordering and were very saddened with what we got.  If you know Rosati's italian beef (from Illinois or from when this loc was previously open) then you know what I was expecting....  an overstuffed sandwhich with lots of peppers and a big ol' pile of melted cheese...that is sooooo far from what I got.  Barely 6 pieces of meat, you could see at least 2 - 21/2 inches of the bread inside the sandwhich there was so little filling. Disappointing to say the least.  The pizza sauce tasted like tomato soup (???) and was close, but not as good as the old ones.  I'm hoping there is a learning curve with the new management, but not going to hold my breath as I have ordered 3 since they reopened and sadly, they were all the same.   Our search continues for good pizza and beef.... sigh.\n",

      "Review :  Years ago I went to try this place because it was supposed to be the absolute best pizza you could get, but when I showed up, there was a line out the door and I didn't feel like standing outside and waiting and I never attempted it again. \\n\\nCut to today around lunchtime and I happened to be in the area and it was open, no lines. Decided to go in and try this amazing pizza. Talk about being underwhelmed. The pizza is expensive and frankly, it's just not very good. I would believe it's very fresh and the ingredients are good, but the end result is a very so-so pizza for too much money. We ordered a total of 5 pizzas, (which are all about 12\\\" and 6 slices), a water, a Coke and 2 teas and the bill was $97 and change. For that kind of money,  I expect an amazing pizza. \\n\\nThe service was very good and they were fast and friendly, but otherwise there is no reason to go there. Of the three different pizzas I tried, none of them were exceptional in any way and no one at the table seemed to enjoy their food very much. Maybe I missed the train on this place by waiting so long, but I see no reason to go back.\n",

Maybe we went on a bad day, but our disappointment went as far as the quality of the ingredients, which isn't something that typically varies on a day-to-day basis.  \\n\\nNow, TC Eggington's is a decent breakfast spot.  I can go there and count on a nicely prepared eggs benedict dish every time.  Crackers is not the type of place that would be capable of making a decent Hollandaise or even poaching an egg properly. \\n\\nI wouldn't be quite so hard on this place if their rating wasn't so outrageous.

My mother and I walked in and all the women were busy so we started taking a look at their books with pictures of cakes.\\n\\nEventually someone came up to us and asked us if we had been helped. I said no and proceeded to ask this person about whether or not they make traditional French wedding cakes. These wedding cakes are called croquembouches. Considering Freed's makes many other things besides cakes I assumed they would at least KNOW what a croquembouche WAS. Well, this lady had no idea what I was talking about. I don't mean to be a snot, and I'm certainly not a snob, but seriously... how can you work in a wedding cake consultation place at a bakery that makes many confectioneries and at least not know what a croquembouche is?\\n\\nAfter my mother and I left the dazed and confused wedding cake woman we went back into the bakery and proceeded to wait a heinously long amount of time to get our 1 piece of red velvet cake and our 1 cannoli.

I should start off by saying that I am not a fan of McGrath - personality wise but, I did (once upon a time) like his food.  Also since I live in far N.S its nice to have options in the area.  We decided to give this place a try last night and what a huge disappointment.\\n\\nWe arrived early for our reservations and were seated directly, the bus boy was very quick with the water - good.\\n\\nWaitress was m.i.a for what seemed sometime - maybe she wasn't told that she had a table.  But, once she appeared all was good.\\n\\nFood...not so good.  The signature pork chile seemed bland (not what I remember it to be) but, good enough.  2 entr\\u00e9es, the pork rack and the short ribs.\\n\\nThe short ribs are absolutely drenched in a Dr. Pepper sauce.  They were moist but, I couldn't taste much beyond that sauce even when I managed to wipe it off the meat.  Overwhelming!  The chile risotto, not cooked properly.  Not al dente simply not cooked.  Also room temperature and absolutely no flavor, despite the fact that I added salt and pepper still no flavor.  The dish did come with a little frisee salad with I believe marinated red onions, this was nice - wish I had more of that on my plate!\\n\\nThe pork rack better than the short ribs but, again no flavor.  The restaurants signature and concept is based around the Wood-Fired Rotisserie, one would think this would impart a ton of aroma and  flavor but, no, nothing.  Again BBB and Dull!  The grits might as well have been cooked in nothing but water.\\n\\nSide - Super Greens, Kale, Bacon, Red Onion, Cider Vinegar - OK there is nothing I love more than kale in any variety and any preparation, I simply love it but, this was the worst thing I've ever eaten in my life.  The kale was tough and had an extremely gamy taste... I couldn't stomach more than two bites then had to send it back.  \\n\\nSomeone did come out to inquire about the kale and offered us another side dish which we declined.  \\n\\nThe service turned out to be very good and we were also offered complimentary desserts which we also declined - at that point we were no longer interested in seeing more from the kitchen.  \\n\\nI'm not sure whats going on in the kitchen but, clearly flavor is not on the agenda - is anyone tasting this food?   At this rate this may go the way of its predecessors - out of business.\\n\\nSo $100+ later and I wished we had just gone across to Grimaldi's for pizza!\n",

      "Review :  I really wanted to pamper myself today and so I scheduled a foot massage and pedicure -- it was the 80 minute version for a whopping $145; I added the french manicure which took it up another $10.  I had a coupon for $30 off a service of $150 or more -- imagine my surprise when they only gave me a $5 discount -- because the final amount HAD to reach $150.  The coupon didn't say that but what the hey -- I didn't argue with them because I wanted to get out of there.  \\n\\nIt took forever to get to the spa -- we were staying on the Venetian side and when I went to check in I found out I had to walk all the way around to the Palazzo side.  When I got there I went to two different \\\"welcome\\\" desks before I found the right one for the pedicure salon.  The salon itself was very nice, my manicurist was very nice but this was way overpriced for the type of service you get.  I could have gone to a nail chop shop by my house and paid a third of the price - and been much happier with the end result.  \\n\\nI recommend finding somewhere else to get your nails done -- it's just not worth it.\n",

      "Review :  Hey there goes Louis Vuitton! Ooooh, Prada! Hello there, Gucci! Wait a minute, aren't there like several other locations of these stores within a 3 mile radius of this place? \\n\\nThere's not really a single accessible store or restaurant in here, and to make it worse, many of the stores in this \\\"new\\\" mall have already existed on The Strip for more than 10 years. With how hard they were trying to make this place \\\"different\\\" you would think they would have brought in something new to the table. For what it's worth, there are some very interesting architectural details and public artwork within this mall worth seeing at least once (I really liked the glowing trees, okay they weren't exactly glowing but I'm not sure how else to describe them), but that doesn't make me any more interested in browsing at a Gucci store when I can just browse at one down the street. \\n\\nExcuse me while I go down to the Fashion Show or the Forum Shops, browse in the super upscale stores I can't afford but can still manage to buy something at a more reasonable store anyway. At least those two malls don't completely reek of pretension and feel closer to the real world if you know what I mean.\n",

      "Review :  Target gets 1 star. And that saddens me. I typically love target. Tonight I went into this super target to get Easter items and a few food items. It was late. This target closes at 9 pm. At 8:45 they started announcing the store was closing at 9, from this point on they announced closing times EVERY two to three minutes, I kid you not. About 5 mins to the hour, I basically had a team me never following or better yet corralling me towards the front of the store, asking what I needed to get. What I needed to find. I was almost to the front and after being told the time was 8:48, 8:51, 8:53, 8:55, 8:58, at 9;00 they shut the lights off but a few. Really?!? Poor taste. Ruined my whole experience. Once I got to the register they could not check me out fast enough and get me out the door. I don't understand how this is acceptable anymore? When I worked retail in my late teens, early twenties, we locked the doors at closing but current clientele could finish up their shopping, and not be reminded every two minutes. For some of us, this is the most convienet time to shop. Target, I might be one, but you will no longer get my dollar.\n",

      "Review :  I contacted Superstition Springs Lexus via the internet and expressed interest in a used vehicle they advertised. We made an appointment to go out and see the vehicle and made sure the internet person was aware I was driving over 40 minutes to see the vehicle.  I received a number of texts letting me know they were waiting for me and provided me with the appointment time via text and email.  So far my experience was great.  About 30 minutes before our appointment, While driving out there, I received a message from a sales person named Steve.  His message said and they were waiting for us and wanted to confirm our appointment.  When we arrived, we met Rashad the internet sales person and he said we would be working with Steve.  We met Steve, and he was not the least bit friendly.  He appeared disheveled and was the typical used car sales person - not what I would have expected at a Lexus dealership.  He started talking about finding us a vehicle to which I told him we were out there to look at a specific vehicle.  He said he knew nothing about it even though I saw he was holding the sheet that had the information about the vehicle we were looking for.  He said he wasn't sure it was available.  I told him that if it wasn't, we would be leaving.  He went  and got the internet guy Rashad and we were advised the vehicle was no longer available but they would be happy to show us a different vehicle.  I told him the least he could have done was called me to save me the drive.  I completely understand that vehicles come and go, but the fact that they didn't advise me  when they had just left me a message, leads me to believe they were up to typical used car sales  tricks.  I'm assuming by the reviews that buying a new car at Superstition Springs Lexus is a different experience than buying a used one.  I made the decision to go to Superstition Springs Lexus because I thought they were a reputable dealership, I wanted to completely avoid the typical used car sales people.  Unfortunately, that's exactly what we got.\n",

      "Review :  MILITARY MEMBERS HATE GOLDS - Everyone I have talked to on base, even those with memberships to Gold's, hates the place because of their greedy attitude and horrible customer service. Gold's Gyms in general and the idea of their atmosphere is second to none.  I love Golds IDEAS and their array of equipment.  This location however.... different story, here is why.\\n\\n     *Military:  Too many problems when moving or deploying or TDY.  Not worth the hassle or time to get a contract with them, they won't help you at all if you go somewhere there isn't a Golds, like Iraq or Afghanistan for instance.  Everyone on base warns about all their crazy fees and how junky their equipment has gotten.\\n     *Staff: Literally ONE blonde girl at the front who is polite, nice, not annoying, and does her job.  Promote her, pay her more, and kick everyone else into shape.  Everyone else is frequently talking on their cell phones, talking to each other, etc, etc.  The personal trainers are more worried about checking out the girls in the gym or chatting with each other than they are with training their clients.  Just this morning I watched 2 trainers not paying attention to their clients, and those people could get hurt if they are not given direction on proper form.  They also don't do a very good job of keeping 12-15 year olds out of the gym.  Benches aren't for sitting in a gym, go back to school.\\n     *Location/Hours: Less than a block from where I live, right off the 215, and 24 hours.  (The only gym within 10-15 minutes of my place and I work crazy hours sometimes, so going to the gym ANYTIME is perfect)  With most memberships you can use any Golds location, which is great if you end up at another location with a Golds in close proximity.  (Hours is the only reason I gave this location 2 stars instead of one.)\\n     *Cost:  Monthly is not bad at all.  For 24 hours and what equipment they have there, good deal.  RATE LOCK AND MAINTENANCE FEES ARE BS at this location.\\n     *Equipment:  Good array of machines, weights, cables, etc.... if they were maintained.  If we pay all this money to come to the gym and have it maintained, you would think SOMEONE would maintain the equipment.  Its a phillips screwdriver and an allen wrench to keep most of these machines maintained, and it is not done often, if ever.\\n     *Pool: good temperature and normally empty.  Everyone I have encountered in the pool has gym etiquette.\\n\\nIf another 24 hours gym opens up close, I think they will put this Gold's out of business.  I loved the Gold's I went to in Phoenix.... this one is mostly a disappointment.  I'll update if things change there.\n",

      "Review :  so, as an auto owner, i've had nothing but good experiences with AAA, from Georgia to NM to California to Mass, and back home to AZ, never a problem. \\n\\nit's the travel department that nearly screwed us for our wedding. way back when, we looked into destination weddings with a AAA AZ branch. our rep always said \\\"i'm looking into it, i'll call you tomorrow\\\" and then a week later, i'd call to ask what the hold up was and was met by the same thing. a month passes by and we find out that rep was fired. \\n\\nso we've got plenty of time and decide to go to a different AAA AZ branch, the one on Glendale Ave. We were greeted with smiles and elations by their travel rep who said she had a great deal of experience with destination weddings and she would handle EVERYTHING to make our experience hassle free and a joy to remember. said she did the same trip (although not for a wedding) for a group of friends every year, so she \\\"knew what she was doing\\\". things went sour from there. \\n\\nwe hardly EVER received return phone calls on time. all the guests we invited that were to book through this AAA branch never received phone calls back. so every-single-one of our guests did their own booking with the hotel and airlines....not just 1-2 guests, all of them. and when we pressed her about this, it was always \\\"oh, my system crashed\\\" or \\\"oh, my phone wasn't working\\\"....come on!\\n\\nfast forward to a week before our trip departure...for our wedding and honeymoon. still no word from the AAA rep. Three days before, we FINALLY get confirmation. you want to see stressed? how about a bride and groom having to wait till the last minute to find out if all their rooms and flights were booked after paying everything up front?\\n\\nbut the proverbial icing on the cake? we were advised to have our invitees \\\"donate\\\" a wedding gift to our wedding through the AAA travel website. that way, those guest that couldn't attend could still give us something and at the end, we'd get a check. \\n\\nunfortunately, it wasn't that easy. at no point were we informed that 10% of \\\"donations\\\" would be kept by AAA. furthermore, my now wife has had to make numerous calls to the AAA office to actually get our wedding \\\"donation\\\" check. it was always \\\"they're cutting the check today\\\"...a week later....\\\"they're cutting the check today\\\", etc. \\n\\nto summarize, i'll keep my AAA for cars only. their travel department was probably one of the most unprofessional, unorganized, and untimely departments i've ever had to deal with. we would've saved ourselves a boat load of stress by doing it ourselves.\n",

Your quality took a nose dive off a cliff into a heap of mediocrity and bad sushi rice. \\n\\nI used to love this place and made a point to come here every time I visited Vegas. For  under $30, AYCE sushi rolls is tough to top, and I guess something had to finally give at Yama. The quality truly is noticeably worse and the rolls are now stuffed with a higher rice to fish ratio. To make matters worse, even the sushi rice quality seemed to have declined as both the texture and flavor are subpar. \\n\\nOn prior visits, I would have given Yama four stars, but based on my most recent visit, I can't give it more than two. Hopefully, they bounce back and I can edit this review later.\n",

I'm fine with there being a wait when I go out to eat. However, this place is not designed well at all for customers that have to wait. There are no seats at the entrance, no benches outside.  The restaurant is CRAMMED with tables so standing at the bar while you wait is uncomfortable for those trying to find space to stand, let alone those sitting down trying to enjoy their meal. Our waiter was sub-par.  When he finally came to our table, he immediately asked if we were ready to order.  Had to ask another waiter for water, and by the time my margarita was served (only because I had to ask a busser if he could check the bar to see if my drink was up there), the ice was melted.

      "Review :  I signed up for the \\\"Black Card\\\" membership ($20/month) over a year ago and was fairly pleased with the experience of working out here. While the service isn't *exceptional*, the price is right and everything is well maintained. I'm sure the \\\"Black Card\\\" membership is perfect for many customers (tanning and aqua massages included, plus free guest daily), I found I wasn't using the additional services. I don't tan or use the massage tables and I rarely bring people with me to work out. But I made a one year comitment to the higher price, which was fine. That was my choice and I can live with cost. The problem came when I tried to downgrade to the $10/month option after my year commitment ended. The gentlman I spoke with told me that I would have to pay a $50 \\\"activation fee\\\" (which was waived when I opted for the year commitment). An \\\"activation fee\\\" after having been a member for 14 months? That's sort of insane after also paying a $40 membership fee each year. When you add in the cost of activation fee and membership fee, I've been paying approximately $28/month. There are plenty of options for health clubs in the $30 range that will even include pools & fitness classes (zumba, yoga, spin, etc.), which Planet Fitness does not offer. \\n\\nAgain, I think there are many customers who can benefit from the black card membership. I'm simply saying that I don't think it is asking too much that someone who fulfilled the terms of their commitment not be taken advantage of when they are trying to continue their membership at a price that fits his/her needs.\n",

And many places ran out of food before the sun went down and this was suppose to go on until 10pm. \\n\\nSome of the best stuff was free. A free sample of pork and a free sample of cheese. The free cheese tent should have been placed next to the Robert Mondavi wine area.  That would have been much more convenient for me. I did enjoy the chocolate fondue from the Melting Pot because well, it's chocolate. I guess I'm lucky that I'll eat just about anything and came hungry. The people watching was the best part.\n",

      "Review :  Went here a couple weeks ago and really enjoyed it. We had a good lunch at a reasonable price. The beer selection is olid (gotta love gumball head) and the truffle fries/tipsy burger combo is bomb. Unfortunately my second outing was bad. My friend wanted to grab a quick burger and my girlfriend and I figured we would join him for a beer. We got in there from the 90 degree heat outside only to realize it was almost a hundred degrees inside! You are new and its the beginning of summer! Get the a/c workin! We were promptly sat by the hostess and looked over the menu for 5 to 10 mins until we found what we wanted. 5 more mins passed and we watched the same three servers walk by our table maybe six times without looking at us. This is a like 10x10ft room with four tables. It wasn't busy. We decided to wait 5 more mins. The guy server looked at us and smiled, giving us hope. He then continued to pull out his phone and text in the corner. Bye bye. We left and opted for the great dane. Tipsy cow, get your act together. You could be successful with your good food and beer, but aweful service will put you under in this competative town.\n",

      "Review :  I probably won't return. I've been noticing these chains popping up all over the Dane County area and decided to stop by for lunch with a co worker while I was in Sun Prairie.\\n\\nWhat I like is that as soon as you walk in, you're greeted by someone who helped you with the process if you're a first timer. This is very different from other sandwich places. You go up to a station where all of their sandwiches are written in bags. So if you want a turkey sandwich, you crab the brown paper bag that has written in the back all of the turkey options they have. They do the same for beef, tuna, veggie, chicken, etc. You grab the bag of the sandwich you want and on the bag, you mark with a provided sharpie all of the toppings you want. This is a really neat idea. I liked the selection process. When you've marked your bag with all of your toppings, which they do provided a lot of choices I must admit, you take the bag to the register to pay and the bag is sent to sandwich artist. They put the finished sandwich in the same bag with your selections. Again, very cool idea. When're sandwich is done, they call you by name. There is a place on the bag for you to put your name down. \\n\\n\\nHowever, they are overpriced for their quality of food. You get to pick from three different bread sizes, 6, 10.5 and 14 inches. For a 10.5 inch, it's $8.25 if you don't add toppings that are priced extra.   The sandwich was just OK. Nothing special. They gave me the wrong mustard but it wasn't a huge deal. My biggest issue is that there isn't any combo special. At least that is not what was told to me. For a 10.5 inch sandwich with not extra priced toppings and a small bag of chips, it was over $10. Had I added a pop, I would have been close to $12. It's a lot of money for a sandwich that's very basic and some chips. If the sandwiches were gourmet or other products were locally made, I totally could see the justification of price. However, the sandwich was just basic.  I prefer Quiznos or Pot Bellys over Which Wich to be honest. I had a lot of toppings on mines, but my sandwich was overwhelmed with mayor and horseradish. I couldn't even taste the other toppings. \\n\\nDoubtful i'd return. They aren't  terribly bad but they are far from greatness. The experience of picking your sandwich is cool but that's really the only positive I have from my first time experience. I can at least day I tried it and seen what they had to offer. Now I know and I won't be returning. I've had better sandwiches elsewhere.\n",

The room in the East Tower was fine and I would rate it about 4 stars but I had to drop stars for the following reasons:\\n\\n1.  When I checked in I let the front desk clerk know my wife & baby will be coming in on another flight and will need to get up to the room while I'm away to the conference.  So she had me write down my wife's name on the room reservation.  When wife arrived she was told that the name was not on the reservation and she had to wait an hour & a half at the reception with a crying baby and had to clean diapers in the public washroom.  When I talked to the manager on duty later his response was \\\"What do you want me to do about it?\\\".\\n\\n2.

Not freshly made or prepared.  It was over cooked white chicken chunks, white or brown onions sauteed in some kind of sugar water.  NASTY.  A small corner of the styrofoam box was a couple of small pieces of iceberg lettuce (aka salad), and an ice cream scoop of dry white rice.  All that for $10.00  Buh bye!!\n",

      "Review :  Went here for a bachelorette party of 12 girls, we had a reservation, waited 10 minutes to be seated, was seated a four different tables that we had to asked be pushed together.  We then sat at least 15 minutes before we were greater and our drink order was taken, but the drinks took almost 25 minutes before arriving.  When our drinks did arrive, the server ran off before taking our dinner order, more time passes... we order and our food comes out pretty reasonably ~15-20 minutes.  When the food did come out three orders were missing completely, our server did not bring our food and was nowhere to be found, we sat waiting until finally she came by.  At this point we've been here well over an hour.  The manager comes by, gets the food out, says that there would be a free round of drinks for the whole table.  I didn't receive the drink promised by the manager and when I asked the server I got a look, this was the first and only time I asked her about anything!?  She brought the drink as I was returning from the restroom and said that an entire bottle of wine would be brought out due to the issues, we explained that we had other commitments that it wasn't necessary.  Then the manager threw in two bottles of champagne, at this point, I'm pretty sure he knew that nobody had a great experience and was trying to save face.  \\n\\nIn the end, the manager was great at covering up for the lack of service we received but with so many options in downtown Charlotte I would chose another place next time.\n",

      "Review :  Prior reviews are right - if you want to take a cab ride home from Phx Sky Harbor you will end up in a yellow cab and it will be a shady experience.  There were yellow cabs lined up as far as the eye could see, it was 3am London time and I just wanted to get back to my car which I parked at my place of employment, corner of University and Mill - that's 5.16 miles for those who care.  Driver never started the meter (I expected the $15 flat rate, see prior comments) and when we arrived he wanted cash only and wouldn't tell me what I owed, instead saying most people pay $16 or $18.  I opted for $18 since this is exactly what I had paid going the other direction trip + tip.  \\\"Why not $20?\\\" he says.  For the love of God, let me out of the cab!!!!!  I seriously don't want to dicker over the cost of the fare.  I'm still waiting for the $20 charge (yes I acquiesced in the name of ending the dickering) to clear my bank and am honestly petrified that some crazy alternate charge will show up instead.

Of the three hours at least 60 full minutes was spent without any food in front of us.  But the best part, incorrect charges on the bill.  Wines prices upcharged on actual receipt to 1.5X the price listed on the menu.  I asked the manager on duty why there was a discrepancy and he went behind the bar, got some cash and gave it to me.  Now mind you, it was of course, no where near the amount I was overcharged but I guess it relieved his conscience.  He handed me the money and said \\\"It will take me too long to find out who your server was and look up the transaction, so here you go.\\\"  Unreal!  Food was average to below average and prices for what you get were a real rip off.  Original style broth that was recommended was so chock full of pepper you were downing water all night - if you could get a refill.  Save your money and time - go buy a fondue pot and do it at home.  You do all your own cooking here anyway so why not.  Will not return.  Hope this saves others a bad experience as well.\n",

      "Review :  I went here for the first time with my friend. She said she's been here more than a couple of times and she said it's good. So I said why not, lets try it. We came in, it was very very slow. We were the only customers. And this is during lunch time which is normally noon. Right as we walk in we were greeted by a lady that could barely speak english let along understand english. \\n\\nWe got to choose our seat, the booth. We were given menus and 3 minutes later the same lady came back and took our orders. I wanted a small at first but when she came back with our waters that definitely tasted like tap water....I changed my mind to get a large because I wanted to take some home for my boyfriend. She couldnt understand me at all, I said it at least five times that I wanted a large and then she just walked away and got another lady that could unserstand...so I told her what I wanted. So probably five minutes later we got our sprites which is pretty much filled with ice to the top..and we got our orders as well my friend (shrimp pho) mine (vegetable pho). \\n\\nOur food got to our table pretty quick. Like it wasnt even ten minutes. As I was taking a sip of my soup and eating my vegetables I noticed at least 10 of my vegetables had dirt on them, they were literally turning black already like they were rotting in the fridge and the kitchen still wanted to serve these vegetables. I picked them out and put them on another plate. I could say out of all my vegetables I didnt eat one cabbage at all because there was black stuff on them....like how unappealing! No one wants to eat food with black stuff on them. The broth was good but what really grossed me out was the vegetables that were already turning black!!! \\n\\nI don't think I'll come back here again. It's way overpriced for bad pho, with vegetables literally rotting in my pho. I don't want that and I dont think people should even be eating that!! that's not healthy at all. Yes they do have an A rating, but that's useless and basically fake if your vegetables and food in the kitchen are rotting and you still serve it to customers! That's just a health hazard! Who knows what else they serve that is rotting. This place needs to live up to better standards. Maybe THEN I will come back and try their pho again.....but not for awhile. I can't stand looking at my vegetables all dirty and rotting in my soup.\n",

      "Review :  I was in the area for lunch and noticed this place. I was in need of a birthday present for my nephews upcoming 2nd birthday. This is normally something my better half would handle but as I mentioned I was in the area and noticed this place and didn't think it would be so hard. I was wrong and will forever gladly let my wife buy all children related things in the future if this is how it all goes down. \\n\\nFirst when I walk in the place was chaos. Kids were running all over and books and toys were scattered everywhere. I felt very cramped and the store just seemed dirty. There was only 1 woman working and she said she was the owner. I explained that I don't usually do this sort of thing and told her what I was looking for. I asked her if she had a couple things that were educational and fun for a 2 year old. She then went on to tell me the store was \\\"her baby and her livelihood\\\" even though I absolutely never asked. She said they offered a service where parents can drop off their kids at her store to be watched while they shop. Serious? Parents are really doing this? The store isn't very big and they just have half of it stuffed with a bunch of overpriced toys and the other half has baby gates closing a section off where parents can leave their kids. Since the kids were running wild and screaming and she appeared to have no help, I asked her if she needed to tend to them while I looked around. She said \\\"oh, 4 of them are mine and only 1 is a drop in so it's OK\\\". NO it's NOT OK! How can this lady work a storefront AND watch 5 kids. I would hope if some of them were hers that they would be better behaved to represent her business better. I was just wanting to get out of there so I grabbed 2 items and got the hell out of there. \\n\\nWhen my wife got home and saw what I picked out she was actually impressed with my purchase until she saw the price I paid. \\\"don't you know Melissa & Doug is a brand and you can get that stuff cheaper on ebay\\\". Dang I already felt out of place doing this whole thing to begin with and now I'm getting annoyed by 2 woman! She went online and indeed found the same 2 items cheaper by $20 including shipping. $20 bucks is $20 bucks right? And then I wouldn't have had to deal with going to this store and could have had it delivered. I might not make these types of purchases often but I do know what good customer service and organization is and I didn't find either here.\n",

Anyhow, I barely even got to look at the menu he handed me and he already asked me what I wanted, so I just basically ordered what I ordered last time which was chicken chow fun for me and orange chicken with a side of rice for my boyfriend... It took a while, but it was fine, whatever, because it's busy. I went back to the front to wait for my food and like 10 minutes later, the same host who helped me asked me if I had been helped... -_- Anyways, I paid right when the host gave me the receipt, but when my food came out, he brought me back to the cash register and tried to have me pay again. Luckily one of the workers there saw that I paid and said that it was okay.\\nI finally took the food home and what do you know?! There is HAIR in the orange chicken... Long black hair.

      "Review :  So so so Dissapointing!!! My friend and I came for a late lunch on Monday, and paid the $19.99. You can also use your M Life rewards card to pay off the buffet, and include a credit card tip when paying as well. It wasn't too packed around 3 PM, and we were starving! We started with the salad bar, and then the side dishes for the meat, some pasta, some Chinese food, and the sad sad sushi bar. Lastly, the dessert bar.\\n\\nSo the Bellagio buffet is smaller than I had imagined, and isn't fancy inside like the Wynn. Our server was nice, brought us our drinks, and constantly took away our plates. So salad bar was typical, the sides we enjoyed were the broccolini, mashed potatoes and turkey gravy (a bit on the salty side), and the creamed spinach. I actually did not eat any of the meats, so I cannot vouch for that. The pastas were all overcooked and no good. I also noticed they had a lot of pesto options available, which is one of my favorites, but it was just mediocre. The pizza selection...there were about 8 different pizzas, but all were just drab. The pesto shrimp was the only one that was okay. The pepperoni was incredibly greasy and had a funky smell to it. There was a bacon and onion thin crust and it tasted so off. I also tried a vegetarian one with goat cheese, spinach and mushrooms, just okay too. \\n\\nThe Chinese selection was the typical chow mein, fried rice, bok choy, and wonton soup. Chow mein and fried rice, just your typical buffet options. My friend said the wontons tasted like cardboard, so I didn't even try. \\n\\nSushi...for lunch, all they had was california roll and vegetable rolls. At dinner time, they put out salmon and tuna nigri, and salmon and ahi poke salad. The salads were swimming in a sea of the Chinese hot sauce, and that's all it tasted like. I had my friend try, and she spit it out. \\n\\nWe rolled into dinner time, and there wasn't that huge of a difference, except there were more people coming through. They brought out the king crab legs, and I never get this, but decided to, hoping something would redeem for this crappy experience. My crab was frozen. I let it thaw, and showed my friend the ice chips falling off. She got a non-frozen piece but said it was too salty. \\n\\nDesserts, ample selection. Their bread pudding is pretty good. Carrot cake is so sweet and not good. Eclairs have chocolate inside too, so too chocolate-y. The key lime tart was not good. The only ones that were okay were the mini fruit tart and white chocolate in a mini waffle cone (surprisingly not sweet). My friend and I were very dissapointed and would definitley not come back again.\n",

It's a little difficult to find, but to the person who said it was behind the waterfall, great job because that is about how you would describe it. \\n\\nI made reservations because they request that you do for a party of 5 or more. They were very accommodating even tho I had to push back the reservations about an hour before our scheduled time. \\n\\nWhen we got there I ordered a vodka, Sprite with house vodka (later on found out that is Aristocrat :P), it was ok. I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai, because at Viet Thai Noodle House this dish is amazing, but I had never had it elsewhere. Other people at the table ordered wine, and sushi rolls. \\n\\nWhen the Pad Thai came out I just did not like it at all. It tasted like the sauce was sweet and sour sauce, which was confusing. \\n\\nEveryone seemed to enjoy their sushi rolls, but when you're ordering just watch what it's rolled in because someone that was expecting the standard rice and seaweed, got cucumber. \\n\\nOverall, I thought the service was pretty good, the prices were good for uptown, but the food was just not there.\n",

I must say that I will probably never go back but am happy that I experienced it once.  \\n\\nWhen you walk in they dress you as if you were a patient in the hospital.

You still have to pay for fries and other menu items which to me does not mean \\\"eat for free\\\"  it should be \\\"only eat single bypass burgers for free\\\"  The burgers are ok.

      "Review :  I am bumping this to two stars because I did get an upgrade while there. I stayed at the Flamingo June 2014 for 4 nights for a conference for work. Checking in was an ordeal, but not entirely their fault. When I finally got into one of their \\\"updated rooms\\\" I was shocked. The bathroom is always the first thing I check out in a hotel room and the bathroom in this room was horrible. I have stayed in hotels in third world countries with better bathrooms. \\n\\nI will say that the nasty room that I was in for the first two nights had an incredibly comfortable bed and pillows, they were actually better in the cheap room than they were in the upgraded room.\\n\\nAnother positive was that their cleaning staff does a good job. I stayed at another hotel after I left the Flamingo and they had a horrible maid service and everything just felt dirty. The Flamingo is an older hotel but you can tell they've been cleaning up messes for years. So my hats off to them for that. \\n\\nThe third morning I was there my friend went to retrieve something from the closet and the whole closet mirror/door fell on top of her. She tried to put it back together but found that it had been duct taped together!!! After two nights of being directly above one of the bars and getting NO sleep because of the bumping base well into the wee hours of the morning. The closet falling on my friend was the straw that broke the camels back. We had to be at our conference at 7 am most days so it was rough not to have quiet until 3 or 4 am and having people run through the halls at 5 am who had been partying all day scream WOOOOO!!!! VEEEGGGASSS!!! Not the classiest bunch of people were staying there when I was there. \\n\\nThe front desk people were very kind to us and got us into another room that had a great view and was much nicer and quieter than the other one. The only problem with that room was that our door wouldn't close properly. I was scared to death and thankful when I heard a knock on my door around 1 am. It was a security guard who let me know that my door was not shut and was stunned to see that no one had noticed the door malfunction. \\n\\nAll in all I loved the location (in the heart of the strip) and it was a very laid back hotel. I think if you were a kid who wanted to party cheaply it would be fun, but for a professional person there on business it was awful the first couple nights. The pool is def a party pool, but if you don't like a whole bunch of 21 year olds rubbing all over each other drunk with a loud DJ its not for you, but it is VERY Vegas!

They do not take reservations so we have left several times because of a long wait. No big deal- this is what they advertise and can be worth it for a good deal. However, my second reason became a deal breaker today. We showed up in the middle of the advertised hours to be told the minnow salon was closed because they had too many other customers in the other part of the salon. They stated this happens sometimes when they are busy. This is a deal breaker for me- if you advertise hours you need to be open during those hours.

They had us sectioned off which was great for privacy & also since the students were loud.\\n\\nTheir service is a hot mess!!!!  They only had 2 waiters serving our 50 person group & it was not organized at all.  Just getting our drinks out was confusing.  The waiters just came out with any drink & then asked -- anyone order this??  This is why my table sat drinkless, breadless, & saladless for the longest time.\\n\\nFor our dinner, we were given a salad, entree, & tiramisu.  The salad was definitely straight out of the bag & doused with some cheap dressing.  It didn't taste fresh at all.  There was a list of 8 or so entrees we could choose from.  They came out quite haphazardly.  I unfortunately ordered the fettuccine alfredo -- worst ever.  I could make better alfredo using the sauce from a supermarket jar.  I tried to douse it with pepper & cheese but alas it did nothing to help it.  Some of the others said the chicken parm was alright but some said theirs was undercooked.  The tiramisu also was gross.  It definitely was made & cut awhile ago & just kept cold in their fridge.\\n\\nThe redeeming parts of this dinner was the decor & old fashioned coin operated games AND the mystery show.  I've never been to one & was really excited.  They started after we ate our entrees & intermissioned during dessert.  The actors were super funny & interactive -- my students loved them which of course makes me happy.  Seriously though, their food is so bad.\n",

I came here not once but twice in the same weekend.  \\n\\nThe first was for beers (a good selection) and enjoyed the artichoke (if a bit watery) and the soft pretzels bites with (really thin) provolone fondue. \\n\\nThe second time was for bunch on a Sunday.  Service was super slow and forgetful. The worst part was the biscuits and sausage gravy.  It was tomato-y.  TOMATO.  I just... *shivers* I don't want to talk about it.

      "Review :  I was a regular at this salon. Sandra was always so amazing and took care of me and made my eyebrows look amazing. Then she got help and things just hit rock bottom for her. The last few months I had gone to her, even requesting that Sandra did my eyebrows I got this other woman to do them and she was good, took a really long time, and sometimes didn't even charge me!! And then the next time I went in she wasn't there which was fine because I had Sandra back. That was the first time I noticed that I had been breaking out like crazy on my forehead and around my eyes. Something that never happened before. I watched her closely after that and after 4 months of going to (twice a month) I realized that she had not been washing her hands or sanitizing them!! Looking back at one of the times she even shook hands with several people that had walked in to meet her before she started threading my eyebrows. The breakout was so terrible, I went to a physician. He said it was the starting stages of what looks like a staff infection. Since then, I have switched to eyebrows r us and the breakout has magically disappeared. I will never step foot in Bollywood ever again!\n",

As I complained to my girlfriend about how many pickles were put on my burger (7-8), she pulls a pickle out of her eggs.  What the hell, lol.  Shortly after that, the waiter noticed that there were a ton of red peppers left on our friends plate.  I guess the kitchen didn't get her food right either, she asked for no peppers.  The waiter had taken the drinks off the bill, which was nice.  But he should have taken her meal off the bill.  I wasn't impressed with the food or service.

I asked him why I didn't get a phone call, he acted surprised and said somebody should have called. He then lays the slings on the counter, but they are not the size that I ordered. He then tells me that the company they order from, Trident, only makes them in certain sizes and they didn't have my size.

Second, my soup and bread bowl came out colder than room temperature and I had to send it back, which I hate doing being a server myself. Third, we told our server, skinny girl with long black hair and purple on top that our parking meter was about to run out so we needed our check. She walked past us again a few minutes later with no check, said nothing, and then another couple of minutes later we see her seating a party of twenty and taking all of their drink orders! Get out of here!! I had to leave the table and go pull the car out while my boyfriend waited for our check another 10 minutes. UNREAL! We still left almost 20%, but I hope she realizes she missed out on the usual 30-40% we normally leave both being servers ourselves. Lastly, a little too pricy for what you get.

I ordered a gyro ($4.50 alone or $5.00 for the combo) and wings  ($7.95).  The total came to $15.95 so I stopped the guy and mentioned this. He said the 2 sides of blue cheese was 1 dollar a piece!  I was flabbergasted.  I mentioned that NO WHERE have I ever been would they charge you 1 dollar a piece!  And they were small sides (1 heaping t-spoon).  I would pay 75 cents for a side at Genos's in Tempe for 3 times that amount of BC (needed for big orders).  Get this though, the guy will charge you 50 cents for substituting blue cheese for the regular side of ranch - because it cost more.  Seriously, 10 cc's of blue cheese is something that is too much to include with meal as every other plae that I have ever been to will?  Needless to say I cancelled my order.   I wonder, was it really worth it for him to lose that business, AND future business?  \\n\\nAs I was driving home, I thought about the 50 cents increase for the special.  I chose a can of coke instead of the fries.  But here's the math:  By his logic, the two small sides of blue cheese cost more than 4 cans of coke or 4 orders of fries (0.50 X 4  = the $2.00 for the sides of BC).  Crazy.\\n\\nI may go back for the gryo because it's on my way to school and back, and just around the corner, and it wasn't bad.  In a pinch will hit the spot, but it won't be regularly I can tell you that.  He could have had a customer a couple times a week and one that bought more than just a gryo being that I love wings and pizza as well.

Now keep in mind I've drank my fare share of grey goose vodka and have NEVER received a headache from it ever, but I sure did last nite. That would lead me to believe they are refilling bottles. I don't have evident proof but a headache is good enough for me. I also witnessed at least 3 patrons that had been over served. Now its time for the stairs.

      "Review :  A good while back, I decided to generally shop at Office Depot, mostly to maximize my \\\"rewards\\\" (such as they are).  So I rarely go to either OfficeMax or Staples.  It also helps that Staples is nowhere near our house.\\n\\nBut when a particular item was supposed to be on sale, and even in stock according to their web site, and I showed up right at opening time, and they had none?  Not the greatest selling point.  I get that web inventory is still not quite correct - though I have no idea why it should be off as the store opens.\\n\\nAs to the store itself?  It is nice enough, though since I do not shop there, I really cannot figure out where anything is located.  It is a good size, and the appearance is nice, but getting help (as has been mentioned previously) can be difficult, making it even worse.  Really makes me not want to go out of my way again.\n",

Spice level was ok, could have had more flavor, heat level was fine.  The \\\"veggie based\\\" rather than cream sauces they tout are a great idea, but sit/walk by the kitchen and look around, you'll see big jars of veggie stock base. You know what that stuff is? Salt, more salt, msg, yeast extract, and some veg flavor.  C'mon, if you're trying to do healthy then why base all your sauces on fake flavored salt paste and pass it off as a healither option.

Things started to go downhill when the waitress brought a wrong dish, never brought the right dish, forgot a glass of wine, and then brought us our check with extra things on it that we didn't order. We asked her to fix it and if she could split the check up. She came back in almost tears saying she couldn't do it and asked if we could just figure it out because she couldn't remember what everyone ordered. We then called the manager over who was not very apologetic or sincere and he asked us, \\\"Well, what do you want me to take care of?\\\" Your not supposed to ask, your just supposed to do it DUH! So we didn't pick anything out for him to take off, we didn't mind paying, we just wanted to pay for the right things! Then he came back after running our cards and he had charged my friend's card more than he was supposed to. We showed him this and he later came back and threw the check down and said, \\\"I just took care of all of it\\\". He then stormed off, not apologizing once. Worst managerial service I have ever come in counter with and the whole process took more than an hour after we had finished eating!\n",

My wife's meal was wrong and she had to send it back (she ordered nachos with chicken) but at first glance my full rack of ribs was fine. As I started eating, my wife asked \\\"Are ribs supposed to be that pink?\\\" The meat was a little pink, but i figured they just wanted them to be tender. However, as i progressed however the rack was less and less cooked, going from pink to red. I looked over at my wife's plate and she was literally picking out the PINK portions of chicken. We asked to speak to the manager and he never came back to the table.\\nLong story short, if you like your chicken rare, and your ribs even more so, then sticky fingers in Ballantyne is for you.

      "Review :  I have used Lori's Grooming for well over a year. I used to bring my dogs to their house to get groomed until they found out that they coudn't groom out of their home anymore. Two months ago we took them to their new Scottsdale location. They had just opened and were quite disorganized as they put it. When I went to pick up my 3 dogs I noticed my cockapoo had a different collar on without her license and name tag and a different leash. I told them that. Lori said at that time she couldn't call of the the people to figure it out because there were too many people in with their dogs that day. They said that we should replace all of the items they lost and they would take it off our next grooming. I replaced all of the items. The cost came to $47.00. Whicjh is actually cheaper than the items they lost. They lost a jeweled pink collar. We booked another appointment for December17th. The owner called me today and told me that I needed reciepts for all of the items I bought. I didnt keep the receipts. He never said I needed to. Obviously, they would have noticed that my dog had a new collar, leash, license and name tag when I brought her in to get groomed. Gregg told me that a replaced license is $4.00. I was incorrectly charged $17.00 by the county. I did save that receipt because it goes in my dog file. Greg also told me that he needs the receipts for his accountant and that he called his accountant regarding this matter. I know that is not true! Greg and Lori, I have referred customers to you that will no longer come to your facility. Is it really worth losing three customers over an incident that occured because of your negligence? Do you really not trust a customer who has been loyal to you? You knew at the time you lost the coillar etc. There are many dog groomers who would be happy to groom three dogs. I always given you both a 20 percent tip even though you were the owners. Hopefully, both owners will learn from this mistake. If not, they will continue to lose clients. I obviously was insulted and would never come back or refer them again! I also went to a veternarians office and told them of my experience and pulled the cards I left them to give to their clients. Their office was shocked. You simply do not treat customers that way. I guess people's true colors show.\n",

      "Review :  (Rant about Cox Marketing, not the acutal store) Where do I begin...I received a marketing call on 9/19/14 from a rep pitching for TV deal. I told him I would only be interested in adding TV service with the existing internet service if I can get ESPN and sports channels. He assured me several times that I would get sports channels with just $30 extra on top of the internet bill. Our household doesn't watch much TV so I wasn't interested HBO or anything but he offered that as well. So I agreed to have TV service installed. I asked him to schedule it for the following Wed as I'm off on that day. So I run my errands and waited for the installer to come between 1-3. By 2:30, I was afraid he's not showing up. I looked up the email to double check the appt time and I realized he scheduled it for 9/25/14, Thur. I was like what?! Why did he schedule it for Thur when I asked him Wed? So that was the first frustrating part. So I called the customer service and rescheduled. Anyway, the installation tech was very friendly and helpful. He apologized he didn't get the order to install for multiple TVs which I told the \\\"marketer\\\" guy couple times that we have 3 TVs. Nonetheless, he took the time to properly install the service. Now is the most frustrating part...NO ESPN or any sports channels! When the markerter was making the sales pitch, I asked him and told him I'd only sign up if I get the sports channels and I mentioned ESPN multiple times. Why? Why? Why? Why did he waste my time and promised something totally false than what he delievered? When I called the customer service again, a couple different guys tried to resolve the issue. They were helpful and apologetic but I wasn't willing to pay $60+ extra for TV service we don't watch much of. So I ended up cancelling the cable right away.\\n\\nMaybe there's too much \\\"pressure\\\" for Cox marketers to make the sale? I really feel like he lied just to make the sale. I asked Cox tireview the call he made on 9/19 and correct the issues. Customers should not be lied to and mistreated. Overall, it was very much of wasted time and a lot of frustration. I will never ever sign up with anything over the phone, esp. through the Cox marketers. \\n\\nI've been using Cox service for many years in the past and I am a happy internet customer. I think they provide reliable and fair service for that so I will continue to use Cox for their internet service.\n",

Some people just want to go to the gym and not be hassled. Even with headphones in, you get tapped on the shoulder. If you don't sign up for your free one time training, calls constantly come in and they question you every time you go into the gym. \\n\\nThe end all for me was when I asked for my dates to be changed for my payments. I was told it was no problem and taken care of. First month that my account was overdrawn, I was understanding and emailed Jay, the owner for confirmation on the date change. He offered free training session. I declined, just wanted to be refunded the 25$ overdraft fee or even apply it to my account for the next month. Jay declined. I tried to be understanding as mistakes can happen and I get that. \\n\\nSecond time was the kicker for when the funds were taken out on the wrong date, it drained my account so I could not fulfill other financial obligations. When contacting the business owner, his response was offering free training sessions again and made it perfectly clear via email that he only wanted \\\"his business to grow.\\\" Jay did not offer to refund the 25$ overdraft fees, did not offer to put it on as a credit to my account, just wanted me to take these classes/training sessions. \\n\\nAfter several attempts at just getting the overdraft credited to my account, I finally reported the business to the BBB. Clearly he does just want his business to grow and is not looking to help those who are inconvenienced by his financial mistakes. I think I will just go back to LA Fitness where they were honest, trustworthy, and did not have an environment where you had to avoid eye contact to make sure no one hunted you down to sign up for more services.\n",

      "Review :  After doing some shopping nearby, I was lured into ATS by their slogan: \\\"Best Carne Asada in Phoenix\\\".  When ordering at the counter, the staff seemed very disinterested in helping customers.  When I finally did order my carne asada burrito, I was given a number and asked to take a seat.  While I waited, I noticed a few other customers wondering what was going on with the bad service at the counter.  When my carne asada arrived at the table, I was starving.  However, the burrito that sat in front of me was tiny.  I'm not really one to complain about small portion sizes, as I feel that most portions are too big, but this portion was just comical.  The burrito was served with a lime wedge that was dry and looked like it had been sliced the day before.  The flavor of the carne asada was bland, as was the texture.\\n\\nOverall, this was a pretty disappointing meal.   \\\"Best Carne Asada in Phoenix\\\" is a really misleading phrase to have on their sign.  This place is not even close.\n",

      "Review :  As someone who is just newly trying to get into cheese, I wanted to come here to pick up some charcuterie and cheese to go along with it. This is a fairly large store, with a large selection of wines, as their name suggests. However, their cheese selection didn't seem as vast, nor their cured meats, which was a bit of disappointment. \\n\\nA few of us still decided to give it a go and browsed a around until the SA was done with his current customer. He seemed to be extremely helpful and friendly while talking to her so we continued to wait. When it came our turn, he wasn't quite as friendly, not that he was rude, but he didn't go that extra mile with us as he had with the previous customer. We asked for some suggestions for soft cheeses, and he had one that turned out to be pretty good. What I didn't like was when we asked for a sample, he just smeared some onto a wax paper and we were basically forced to lick it off the paper, and there were 4 of us sampling it. There has to be another way for sampling soft cheese.\\n\\nWe also purchased some cured meat, which was on the pricier side. Our friend had the bresaola and it had a strange taste. It had a strong mineral taste and it wasn't the right texture. \\n\\nI'm sure this place is great for wines, but their selection of cured meats and cheese didn't have as great of a variety and was overpriced. Maybe if I become more cultured in wine I'll be able to appreciate this mom and pop shop more, but until then, I will try to find another place for the charcuterie.\n",

      "Review :  One star because I can't give zero.  Or maybe a star for the server - after her initial bitchiness i got the feeling that she felt sorry for my hungry ass.  Why?  Because it took about an hour for me to get my food - and when it came it wasn't worth the wait.  Here's the deal - I walked in alone and asked to be seated outside. The restaurant was crowded and the music really loud.   When I sat down a seemingly nice server came over took my drink order (hot green tea) and brought it over pretty quickly.  I had already decided what to have - I'm a creature of habit when it comes to sushi, so I placed the order, sat back and relaxed to enjoy reading my book.  About 15 minutes later, the server comes over to say that the sushi bar is slammed and that it will take 30 more minutes for my food to prepared.  When I communicated to her that I wasn't really happy about this, she told me that she'd understand if I left.  But where am I going?  By the time I get up and walk over to another restaurant, wait for a table and be served, it would take longer so I decide to stay.   What a mistake.  After half an hour comes and goes, I turn around to look inside and THERES NOBODY SITTING AT THE SUSHI BAR!!!  I was pissed!  Why am I waiting???  Apparently there were two large tables that ordered a lot of food, but WTF???  I'm one person who only ordered a few pieces of sushi for gods sake.  I finally say to the girl  - hey - can they at least send me a portion of my order???  So she comes back with half the order and about 10 minutes later the rest.   I take a bite and am gobsmacked to find the rice practically crunchy.  It was actually hard.   So I picked away most of the rice, ate the fish and asked for the check.  A manager came over and offered me a drink coupon for my next visit.  Did she not notice that I was drinking tea?   I told her that I don't live in the area and asked that she take something off the bill - which she did.  But nothing would inspire me to go to this restaurant again.  I mean, really - it's a large place that seats tons of people.  You'd think that they'd be prepared to feed the amount of people who occupy the place in a somewhat timely manner.  While it was crowded, it wasn't like there was a wait out the door and every seat filled.  Talk about poor management.  Find your sushi elsewhere in Scottsdale!\n",

      "Review :  I was disappointed in the show because about 15 minutes into the show, I realized I was not watching the original members. And what tipped me off was the 6'-2\\\" tall, 220 lb dude in a mask. If you are a die hard fan, you can tell by the movements that they weren't the members you saw on television. The show I watched was pretty much watching the equivalent of a cover band playing your favorite band's music. It was still good, it just wasn't what I thought I was paying for. I did complain to Monte Carlo to try to get my money back and this was their response:\\n\\n\\\"All performers are indeed Jabbawockeez, in every performance. They have expanded their crew and on any given performance, they rotate.\\\"\\n\\nI know some of the dancers are Super Crew members during the b-boy numbers, but you can tell that the routines for the original members were filled in by other dancers. They did do a decent job though, but I still would not buy another ticket to see them perform. I would pay to watch them again if I knew for sure it was going to be the original members. My 2 star rating would be bumped up to 4 stars if that was the case.\\n\\nOther than that, the show is about 2 hours long and more than half of that is filled with comedic mime skits and audience participation numbers. Totally understandable because it would be hard to fill two solid hours of dancing routines. The dance routines were well done. If you have seen all their you-tube videos, you have seen all their dance numbers in the show.\\n\\n2 Stars... JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED!!!\n",

What I found was that I had to sort through over 15 dirty plates with food still on them sitting on the counter that I was expected to use for my food, pizza that appeared grease soaked and had been sitting for an extremely long time, and very little selection of pizza available.  After trying to eat a piece of the older pizza I waited for over 15 minutes for a (as in one) new pizza to be put up on the counter.  The pepperoni pizza had a small hint of cinnamon flavor probably due to not cleaning the pans well enough and was nasty.  I decided at this point I would give up on the food.  \\n\\nBesides the food being poor the guests that were here were even worse.  I understand that Peter Piper Pizza does not have control over its patrons but I will not be visiting this establishment again.  In trying to eat my pizza I had one person listening to some terrible rap music on his phone so loud the entire side of the establishment had to listen with him.  Whats worse is he didnt even purchase anything, he simply entered, sat, and listened to his phone.  I also felt like I was trapped between a gang territory dispute with one guy having his pants around his knees holding his shirt up in an attempt to flash his giant metal belt buckle to another group of thugs.  Its sad to see that a place I used to take my kids frequently has got this bad and I also can see why I travel the extra distance to go to a cleaner and safer location.\\n\\nAll in all I am very dissatisfied with my experience and will think again when deciding where to spend money for food.\n",

When I was taken back to get x-rays I was surprised to see the frowning faces of the tech and the dentist. X-rays were taken by the tech and the tech also did my cleaning.  It was the worst cleaning ever!!!  She basically just brushed my teeth. My 3 year old could have done a better job. When finished the tech didn't say a word to me. I just sat in the chair thinking the doctor was going to come out to talk to me,  but instead the recptionist Tina came to talk to me about my x-rays , payment plan,  insurance coverages, etc. Where is the dentist? I turned around and there she was in her office watching a show/movie on her laptop.  Poor, poor customer service. I never went back to get any work done.

In addition to my previous review I have few more issues with this stadium.\\n\\nThis was a major event.  A sellout.  This sort of thing only happens a handful of times a year at cashman.  There was absolutely nobody directing traffic.  Nobody at the 95 and Vegas blvd.  Nobody at Vegas blvd and Bonanza.  Nobody at Vegas blvd and Washington.  I don't expect to not wait in traffic.  But I do expect a minimum amount of event planning when this event has been held for countless years and I pay double the amount of what a spring training ticket should cost.\\n\\nIn addition to nobody directing traffic, there was also no security or no ushers once we arrived 30 minutes late.  Security is needed because there are dogger fans.  Everyone knows that dogger fans are classless and typically carry weapons.  Nobody checked my bag when entering.  I didn't pay ridiculous ticket prices just so I could be stabbed by a thug.  \\n\\nUshers are needed because apparently people from Las Vegas have never attended a baseball game.  Lots of people sitting in the wrong seats.  Lots of people going up and down the aisles while a player is batting.  This shouldn't be happening.\n",

      "Review :  It makes me really upset to have to write this follow up review, but in light of recent events my opinion of this dealership has completely changed, and I no longer feel comfortable recommending this place. \\n\\nSo the scenario is, I purchased my most recent vehicle from Cardinale Way in August 2012. On April 13, 2013, I received a letter from a law firm stating that they had been contracted by Cardinale Way as debt collectors for an outstanding debt I owe the dealership. In looking over the paperwork they sent me, this \\\"outstanding debt\\\" is a $300 down payment that the dealership was suppossed to automatically deduct from my checking account the week after I purchased my car. Keyword here being \\\"automatically\\\". Apparently they never did this, and this entire time I've owned be car (8 months now) the dealership has never contacted or notified me that this debit never occurred. \\n\\nOn top of everything, it is now 2 weeks later since having recieved this letter, and absolutely no one from the dealership has contacted me back to resolve this matter. I have left a voicemail with accounts receivable, left my issue on their Facebook page (to which someone commented, but they never actually called me to resolve the issue like they said they would) and I even called and spoke with their GM (who said he would get right on the issue and would call me back - it's now a week and a half later and nothing). \\n\\nApparently no one at this dealership feels the need to be accountable for their customer's experience once they've sold them the car. \\n\\nI will not be returning to this dealership with my business, nor will I ever recommend them again.\n",

      "Review :  I made my first trip into Five Guys last week. It is a nice time to try new places in Madison, because the students have largely left and this reduces the crowd. I was a bit shocked at the prices (a cheeseburger, fries and pop totaled over $12); however, I stuck it out as I was really in the mood for a burger.\\n\\nI'll start with the good part. The service is quick and the staff was friendly. The fries, while seemingly expensive, were very good and provided enough (at the \\\"little fries\\\" level) to serve at least two, not three, people. The restaurant was clean and enjoyable. \\n\\nOne thing about the fries: if you are truly unable to digest flour, they coat their fries with it. I don't know if they offer a gluten free fry, but you should ask. \\n\\nNow to the burger. Oh my. I ordered \\\"all the way\\\" which is the cheeseburger with everything (onions, tomato, pickles, mushrooms, ketchup, mustard ,etc). I didn't really want mushrooms but it was easier to say \\\"the works\\\". The propaganda for the restaurant (and many of the reviews on this site) promote the idea of a burger made from quality products and cooked to order. The burger was cooked to order\\n\\nThe burger was okay. juicy and thick, but part of a parceled package, not made from local meat or hand pressed. The mushrooms were, sadly, canned and tasteless. The tomato slice (singular) was nice and seemed fresh but it was swallowed up by the other toppings. The cheese, in Wisconsin no less, was basically Velveeta. The worst aspect was the bun: a cheap white bread sesame seed covered bun. It managed to hold together to the 6 minutes of processing time in eating, but was completely unenjoyable and generally complimented the cheapness of the mushrooms and cheese. \\n\\nFor the price asked, a much better burger could be had at the Red Shed (just a block away) or Dotty's Dumplings, The Nitty Gritty (also within a few blocks. I get that the State Street location pushes up the rent and the cost, but I can't believe the other reviewers are eating at the same place.\n",

Customers were confused because the cashier was calling out the wrong orders and people were returning saying it wasn't what they ordered.  By this time, there were 8 or 9 of us waiting...it was a hot mess in there.\\n\\nI went for the Carne Asada Burrito first.  I took one bite and didn't like it...it was way too salty.  The Burrito was all Meat & a little Guac/Salsa combo...no Rice or Beans...that's a common recipe in some of these Taco shops.  Since there wasn't any other ingredients to soften the salty flavor, it was just bad.\\n\\nNext, I went for the Beans/Rice/Cheese (BRC) Burrito.  I took one bite and that one was bland.  I don't know if my taste buds were shot from the salty Carne Asada Burrito, but it wasn't good either.\\n\\nThe Salsa wasn't *meh* too and couldn't save it for me.

      "Review :  My hubby and I came here on a Saturday night because we were both starving and every other place nearby had a long wait.  That should have been a big red flag.  The food and the service were both sub-par.  Our server disappeared for long periods of time without checking on us and seemed annoyed that we were inconveniencing him by being there.  The busser kept my hubby's ice tea full but then failed to take my plate once I was done eating.  It literally sat there for the entire 20 minutes we waited for our server to bring us the check and then was still there when we left.\\n\\nWe started with the calamari which had a great flavor, light breading, and came with two tasty dipping sauces.  However, the calamari itself was really overcooked and rubbery.  The hubby had a pasta dish which he thought was pretty good.  But it's hard to screw up a basic rigatoni and red sauce. I ordered the eggplant napoleon.  The description sounded fantastic: eggplant, portabello mushrooms, roasted tomatoes, balsamic vinegar; all my favorites.  It arrived with a beautiful presentation (see pic) so I was really excited to try this dish. The actual flavors really fell short.  Vegetables were overcooked, cheese filling was bland, and the sauce was oily.  The dish just didn't pop.\\n\\nOverall, I liked the cool, modern vibe of the place.  Though the electronic music got really old.  It ranged from some songs that were kind of techno jazz background music to some songs that were sort of like acid house music.  It was weird.  Other than that its a comfortable, cool place and I would consider giving them another chance if there weren't so many other better options in the area.\n",

      "Review :  I must have a sign on my back that says, \\\"Please make my purchase with your company as large of a cluster-f*** as possible.\\\"  I thought The Room Store had horrible service, but DirecTv takes the gigantic crap-filled cake.  \\n\\nHaving just purchased a new condo in Tempe, I kind of would like to have things set up relatively quickly.  So, the week before I'm set to move in, I go online and set up a package deal for internet/phone/tv through Qwest (who uses DirecTv for the TV end of the deal).   Qwest sets up an installation date for the second day after I move in.  I'm thinking, \\\"great, that was really quick.\\\"  One problem:  Qwest only set up the phone and internet.  At no point did they tell me beforehand that I needed to set up a seperate install time with DirecTv.  Since I made a one-stop purchase, I assumed a one-stop installation.   \\n\\nI was wrong. \\n\\nVery wrong.  \\n\\nOn September 30, I called to set an installation time with DirecTv.  Having just purchased an HDTV, I requested an HD tuner (duh).  They said the earliest possible install date would be October 25 for even basic, normal, no HD equipment.  I grudgingly accepted that date.  What else could I do?\\n\\nFast forward to October 24.  I'm excited to finally get TV in my condo.  However, I have yet to receive any kind of call to set up a time for tomorrow's install.  I decide to call DirecTv and see what was up.  Guess what?  Not only was I never put on the schedule for a delivery date and time, but even if I was, they have a backorder on the tuners for an unspecified amount of time.  I asked the supervisor what day I could expect to actually get installed, he said, \\\"I don't know.\\\"  That's a pretty effing bad answer if you ask me.  Furthermore, while they were willing to do a basic install (about a week from now) and then bring the HD tuner when it came into stock, they said I would be charged twice for installation, and when the tuner actually did arrive, I would have to cancel service and then reactivate service with all sorts of fun fees they were unwilling to waive.  \\n\\nThe bottom line is, it will likely be two months between the time I ordered my service and the time it actually gets installed.  \\n\\n\\\"Somebody up there loves you\\\", but it sure as hell isn't me.\\n\\nUPDATE:  I finally got installed, and guess what?  It looks like total crap.  Their \\\"custom\\\" install involved propping the satelite dish on my balcony and advising I \\\"go buy concrete blocks to keep it from blowing over\\\" and then running cables through my window and my sliding door and across my carpet.

We tried the calamari which was greasy, the bread was stale, and the $28 halibut en papillote tasted like dirty dishwater. The only thing that was any good was the lobster bisque but not the best I've ever had by a stretch. This is definitely a no-go. There are way better places to spend money on food in Vegas.\n",

      "Review :  It used to b one of my fav restaurant till tonight. (As u can see i placed 4th for check in to this place) The GM in Tempe has no skill in serving industry at all. He pretty much ruin our night over a $4 roll. He explained to us the yelp deal r only allow one per table (as we didnt know n we were using two coupons in same table but two separate checks like always) my friend joked to him n say he can take the order back since she didn't even eat hers. He replied with very rude attitude, \\\"yeah I can do that. I'm just gonna throw them away. But u can only use one coupon per table!\\\" So he took the order back along with my two extra piece (my leftover I didn't want) he rather end biz n pissed off their customer over $4 Cali roll...really?! All he did was prove his point-that he is right n customers r wrong.  I had never seen any service like that ever! Corp office will hear from me as soon as they open on Monday\n",

      "Review :  I love cupcakes, so it was exciting to be in a new state and try a Cupcake War Champion. Being our first time in Phoenix we got lost trying to find this place. We were on 7th Avenue by mistake and then we found 7th Street but they do not have an \\\"Urban Cookies\\\" sign out front, so we passed it. Not fun. When we did get there, it felt dead, the server was not very engaging. They had no chocolate flavors, no brown velvet, no smore cupcakes. Which is a  shame, i really wanted to try the brown velvet, it was the reason we drove to find them. We had a banana cupcake and a lemon cupcake. A banana cupcake is very hard to achieve in my opinion, because it can easily become a dense muffin. Magically they did achieve fluffy cake but was ruined by the dense greasy frosting. It left the greasy coat on my lips. The lemon drop was not my favorite, too sweet. I normally would not get these flavors but since they were out of their star cupcakes we were left with \\\"mehh\\\" cupcakes. A shame.\n",

      "Review :  I wanted to like this place.\\n\\nWent on a Wednesday night in summer, around 8 for dinner.  Just three of us. We walked in to ask for a seat on the deck, was told 'no problem, just sit anywhere'.  So we did. \\n\\n10 minutes later the server arrives. 3 beers and a water. About 10 minutes later for the beers. Another 10 minutes for the water, which I found extremely odd as you don't need to wait for the bar staff to pour a glass of water. \\n\\nFinally get our order in about 30 minutes after being seated. \\n\\nMy table mates finished their beers but no sign of our waitress. After about 20 minutes from when we gave our order, my friend gets up to search out some beverages. While inside he finds our waitress who tells him that they ran out of one of the entrees we ordered. 20 minutes AFTER we ordered. \\n\\nTo recap till just now: we've been there for close to an hour, have been served one beverage and had to seek out the waitress to find out they were out of something we ordered 20 minutes ago. \\n\\nThe waitress very half heartedly apologizes and says she'll ask the kitchen to rush a second burger. Rushing the cooking of meat is not something I'd usually hear a restaurant say they'd do. \\n\\nAnother 10-15 minutes for the first two entrees to be brought out. Another 10 for the last one. \\n\\nTo their credit the burger was good. The rosemary tater tots were fried in too low heat, they were greasy, not crispy. \\n\\nBut I can't get over the terrible service and will not be back. There are too many good restaurants in Charlotte and especially in NoDa to settle on this level of service.  It shouldn't take two hours plus hours for burgers and beers.\\n\\nTip to the server: don't keep your patrons waiting for beer and be upfront on what's been sold out (it should not take 20 minutes for that info to reach the customer!). Not being proactive on either account is just unprofessional.\n",

      "Review :  Madison, may we have a moment of silence for the old La Guanajuantence?\\n\\nAs sadly reported by yours truly in November of 2011, it appears as though La Guanajuantence is under new management, and new doesn't mean better.  What was once the best burritos, tacos, and salsa location in all of Madison is now nothing more than your standard el cheapo Mexican restaurant.\\n\\nI took a coworker here for lunch today with the hope that things were back to normal, but alas, we were both sadly disappointed.  We arrived at noon, and were promptly shown to a table, which featured the dirtiest, nastiest, most caked-up hot sauce dispensers I've ever seen.  \\n\\nOur waitress brought chips, took drink orders, and left us to browse the plain-old-typing-paper-menus.  \\n\\nWe walked up to the \\\"salsa bar\\\" which now consists of a bussers tub filled with ice and \\\"stocked\\\" with six (6) small clear plastic containers of salsa: avocado, traditional, chipotle, green chille,  tomatillo, and one mystery salsa.  While the presentation was pathetic, the salsas were decent, although most tasted very similar.\\n\\nThe waitress returned to take our order, which consisted of a steak burrito, a chicken burrito, a chicken taco, and an al pastor taco.\\n\\nThe food arrived after a short wait, and my fears were confirmed - the burritos are over-stuffed with cheap Mexican rice, complete with canned peas and corn, heavy on the lettuce and cheese, and very light on meat and/or flavor.  My friend said that he would've rather had a McDonald's breakfast burrito than this $8 abomination.   \\n\\nI snapped a quick picture of the burrito - you can see how little steak there is (what steak that was there was nearly tasteless, very dry, and extremely gristly)...\\n\\nThe tacos... I love street tacos.  But both the chicken and the pastor were dry, flavorless, and unimpressive.  SIGH.  The pastor was chewy/stringy... And my coworker's chicken burrito came slathered in cheese for some reason... \\n\\nWe paid our tab, left, and I vow to never return.  It's simply not worth it.  Granted, the service was nice, but the food has gone so far downhill, there's no saving it.\\n\\nLa Guanajuatence = FAIL FAIL FAIL\\n\\nFood = 0.5 stars (the salsas were ok)\\nValue = 0.5 stars ($8 for a rice-stuffed burrito?)\\nService = 3 stars (friendly and attentive)\\nMISC = 1 star (the crusty condiments and lackluster salsa \\\"bar\\\" weren't cool)\\n\\nOff to find a new taqueria.  -sob, sniff, sob-  I miss the old Guanajuato.\n",

      "Review :  I don't know why this always happens to my mom, but she seem to have the worst of luck at places like this. Unfortunate situations always occur to her when she is just minding her own business.  She was just standing near the pool and watching the dolphins play when two of the male dolphins began to fight. The fight was so violent that both dolphins landed on the cement and began aggressively hitting there tails at each other. This was less than 2 feet away from my mom. My mom and another woman ran for their lives. Both dolphins were cut and bloody due to the severe fight, and flopped back into the water to continue the fight. The staff didn't say sorry and just explained to her and the other woman that male dolphins fight over territory. Of course it ruined my mom's trip. She came here to relax because the night before she got a phone call that informed her that her Dad had died. I should have brought her to the Mandalay Bay Shark thing. \\nThe day just got worse at the Tiger and Lion exhibit. One of the tigers decided to take a piss towards the crowd of people watching.  I had no clue that a tiger could piss that far of a distance. The people all ran backwards, but thought it was funny. They were laughing because it missed them, but I bet if it actually hit them they would be pissed off as hell. \\n\\nSo, I guess this place ain't 100% safe. So my advice is to hold onto your young children, and don't let them get too close to the dolphin tanks.  \\n\\nIf management is reading this and thinks I am exaggerating, go check out the security tape and see for yourself. I came on 2/26/2012 around 3pm. \\n\\nA lot of crazy sh!t happens here btw...\n",

The customer service is consistently poor and in a day and age where the average consumer has a multitude of meal options in front of them, what really sets places apart is how they interact with patrons. When a manager/owner is rude, abrupt and downright disrespectful to customers, what is to be assumed except that they don't value their business. \\n\\nI do wish them luck as a mom & pop shop.

      "Review :  I order from this location at least once a week. I've never had any problems with my orders but maybe that is because I order in the early afternoon and the location doesn't have such a ghetto staff working! Anyways I order the same things ever time so I know how my food should look and taste. For this order I ordered a meat lovers pizza. When I get the order as soon as I opened the box I knew it wasn't correct. A meat lovers should have ham, pepperoni, beef, italian sausage and bacon on it. It had 3 out of 5, on top of that I asked for extra sauce on the side and didn't get that either. So I called (The order was wrong and I had every right to. When you order and PAY for food to be made you expect it to be correct). The manager I spoke to, MIKE, was dismissive from the start. When i told him the pizza was missing topping like bacon, he then said the meat lover's pizza doesn't even come with bacon on it unless it is asked for (As I am looking at the website because it as up from me placing the order and on top of that I order it all the time. So he LIED and for no reason! Then he offered a credit. I thought that would be fine but then I began to eat the pizza... It was gooey and had a weird taste. Then when i peeled back the toppings it was RAW! Disgusting! I called back and again he didn't want to take responsibility for the employee who made or should I say rushed my pizza because at one point he was saying they were in a rush to leave (I placed my order at 9:35 so it wasn't like I ordered before closing) Then he said in a rude voice I can come pick up anther pizza. If I wanted to come there and could get there I wouldn't have had it delivered. And the guy was so ghetto I would not have trusted him to not do something nasty to my food. MIKE didn't speak with any type of professionalism for me to trust he would be professional enough to make me a new one. They should have a class on empathy and how to properly deal with complaints, and some training on how to follow directions when making a pizza!!! I usually wouldn't even bother to complain but I've work in the food service industry and there is no reason to treat anyone rudely or have a bad attitude. So thanks MIKE (If thats your name) the manager for ruining my appetite and night!\n",

      "Review :  For a new hotel I was surprised with the lack of quality with this place. It seemed like they cut a lot of corners when making this place. First, there was no line when I walked in. I don't know if they are trying something new at this place or what but the concept does not work. You have a melee of people trying to get a spot and no one to really guide what's going on. My buddy who was also staying there ended up waiting 40 minutes when his key didnt work and he had to get a new one. Terrible service. \\n\\nOnce up to the room, you get surprised with the automatic blinds and a great looking room but that's where things end. My bed was collapsed on one end...how does this happen in a new hotel and how do they not replace it? The walls were paper thin. I could hear everyone's conversations! It didnt matter if there were yelling or talking at a normal level...I could hear it. \\n\\nOut of the room things were no better. Try to eat in the hotel and you will pay top dollar for average food. The buffet will charge you extra for their weekend brunch when its simply no more than left overs from the week prior (trust me I ate there about 3 or 4 times and the items were starting to get old). They did have some interesting things on the menu such as goat but it hardly justified the price. I also went for a burger in the main cafe type restaurant and ended up having to pay extra for every addition on top of the bun and meat. I think I ended up with a $25 burger that I could have gotten at Burger King for less than $5....my total meal with drink and salad came out to over $40!. \\n\\nThe hotel bars were ok but became over crowded as there isnt much to do here and you're always looking to go else where. I also don't like over whelming smells and the air fragrance they pump into the hotel is absolutely obnoxious. I could actually smell people at my convention who had been staying at the Aria because you could smell that horrible fragrance. \\n\\nNever again will I stay here.\n",

Sure they sell the used appliance but what they don't tell you is that within the 30 days you find an issue they will refuse to fix it.  They schedule a repair man to come out, which by the way didn't happen on the scheduled date, because Becky has no clue where her employees are at.  He finally comes out and says it is the thermostat, couple days to order the part and he will call us.  Well the couple of days came and went and now it has been over a week and now Becky has decided to take an extended vacation and can't be reached.  My advise to Sun Cities Appliance,   Close your doors until you can live up to what your business is trying to do which is \\\"selling slightly used but in work condition\\\" appliances. Stop taking advantage of the people of Sun City and return people's money since you are breaking your own contracts.  You should not offer store credit when all you do is sell crap.  If you refuse to fix, a full refund is in order.\n",

Today was the worst experience I've had in a restaurant.\\n\\nWe arrived at 11:30 and there were 7 tables seated and none of them had ordered and were waiting on menus, their drink orders to be taken and then their food order to be taken. As we were all waiting several other parties were seated and their drink orders and food orders were taken immediately before the 7 tables that were already waiting.\\n\\nThe waitress today was the most clueless I've ever seen. She would just walk back and forth through the restaurant doing nothing while everyone was waiting to be served. She would ask someone for their drink order and go get one ice water and not bring back the other tables drink order that she had already taken.\\n\\nThe worst problem was after a LONG wait for our food she brought them out and walked right past our table and I noticed it was our order. However, she walked it over to a table with seven people and asked them who had the \\\"fried rice and sweet and sour chicken?\\\". They all told her they didn't belong to that table yet she sat the meals down in the middle of their table and walked away. They all started looking at one another wondering why the heck she left them there and she was walking past our table I said \\\"I think those were our meals\\\" and she went over and picked them up and brought them to us and didn't say a word. We never got a refill on our drinks, we didn't get the spice tray or sweet and sour sauce we asked for.\\n\\nThe food tasted totally different and was not the same recipe they normally use. The food was cold when it came out and had no flavor at all. My fried rice looked like white rice with some broccoli and onions in it and wasn't fried at all.\\n\\nFirst time in my life I didn't tip a waitress. If I ever go back and see that same waitress I will turn around and walk out. This was not the Asian waitresses that normally work there, this one looked Hispanic and she was terrible.

But when you get down to it, it is only 7 rings. One thing about onion rings is you need to use savory onions along with a great tasting batter. Neither of these two main things were present. The batter is flavorless and falls off into one big mess. The onions were so hard they were not even cooked. When frying foods you need to make sure things are fully cooked. In this case size makes no difference. \\n\\nI've had the burgers there and are generally, bleh, same as everyone else. Nothing special.

I wanted to be there when it opened so I could get a shade area in the grass. At this point I was thoroughly confused so I decided to call and listen to the message. The message seemed to be updated since they posted the date and time their summer weekend hours started, which was 10. So we got there at 9:45. The parking lot was empty so I went to the front to see if hours were posted. On a chalkboard it said they are open at 11. As I was walking back to the parking lot someone who was operating a leaf blower told me it opens at 10. I explained that the sign said they open at 11 but he assured me they open at 10. I don't think he works for the company so I disregarded what he said. When I saw someone in a golf cart I asked him. He was wearing a big surf shirt so I knew he would have accurate information. He told me it opens at 11. I told him that I checked the phone message and that it said they open at 10. He shrugged his shoulders at me and said, \\\"well, we open at 11.\\\"  He absolutely didn't care about the inconvenience that I had experienced even after I explained it to him. He was actually very rude to me then drove away in his golf cart. The general manager, Bob, is in serious need of customer service training. He does not care about the customer, customer satisfaction or his job. \\n\\nBesides that, as soon as I entered the park I noticed that the trash cans were already completely full. It looked as though things were not cleaned up from the day before. The bathrooms were just disgusting. It was out of toilet paper but there was soap and paper towels. Each time I used the restroom I never once saw people wash their hands. They just walked out, which doesn't have anything to do with Big Surf but it just added to the feeling that this is a dirty place. My boyfriend told me that the men's bathroom was out of paper towels all day. No one went to clean or check on them for the entire day. The park looks like they need to do some major renovations. \\n\\nThe lines are not as busy as other water parks, so that's a plus. But there is also a reason why I suppose. I won't be back.\n",

The server was pleasant enough, but neglected to advise me that they do not have green peppers to put on my pizza. The entire table heard me, so when my pizza came out it was covered with pepperocini. I sent it back, and they remade it, but the experience left a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended). One can get much better pizza and service at Nello's a few miles away, or Humble Pie. It will be a long time before I go to Carrabba's again.\n",

Then found there is no place with this name.  No street sign, no door marker legend, no mailbox.  Nothing.  We had to do some hunting and asking (I hate asking) and found out the truth.

I didn't even look at the menu because I've read the Yelp reviews of Jesse and Darren, so think I'm informed.  In a decisive sweep of confidence I ask for the Chipotle bowl\\n .... and get blank stares. \\nThey don't know what this is.  I finally look at the menu and its not there.\\n\\nI order the closest thing, The sizzling bowl.  It arrives and is just what I ordered, a bowl of rice, some chopped small chicken smothered in Spicy sauce with a few Jalapenos.  Add a small drink and I'm at $8.90 with tax.  Although plentiful It was just OK, absent of any veggies but then again all of the bowls are just meat, rice, and sauce except the Veggie Bowl. \\nThe girls from the office that I took here for lunch glared at me.

We stayed for five nights which is why we skimped on accommodations.

They pushed several competitions throughout the year so we decided to train for one and try it.  My son was only 4 at the time of his first competition.  We paid A LOT of money on top of the already expensive tuition to have one on one sessions to train for competition.  When it came time for the competition we found out they don't send their instructors and we were completely on our own.  EVERY other studio sends instructors along with a team of supporters for their competitors.  We continued to compete, and the kids who represented Sandoval usually ended up with first place wins.  Their training and trainer was amazing, but was often denied permission to attend competitions.  The kids were NEVER recognized for their achievements on their website or Facebook page.  Karate was my son's main passion and now it's really fizzled out.  He was in the same class for over 9 months and had so many younger/new kids join that he completely dominated the class when the sparred.... not in a good way because it didn't make him any better of a fighter.

      "Review :  I do not recommend this school. I was extremely dissatisfied with the school's inflexible policies, the communication rendered by employees, and the effects enrollment there had on my child.\\n\\n1) Incompetent Care\\nThe entire time my three year old attended, she had a rash on her rear, as they did not wipe her properly when she used the bathroom. Three year old's need assistance in getting cleaned up after they go potty - this is daycare 101. As soon as my child would come home, her rash would clear up - then return during the next week at school. I spoke to the employees at the school about this on several occasions and nothing was done to correct the problem.\\n\\n2) Forced Naps\\nTwo hours out of the five my daughter attended Scottsdale Academy daily, the children were required to nap. No provision was made for children who don't nap (mine just happens to be one of those kids who don't). They are not even allowed to quietly read or draw - they are forced to lie there. Failing to provide an option for a quiet activity / assuming all children fit one mold is simply bad childcare.\\n\\n3) Inflexible Policies\\nThis school requires that you pick up your child at a certain time, regardless of what time you drop them off. For every five minutes you are late, they charge you $5.00. They are completely inflexible about this regulation, even for moms who have other kids to pick up across town after school. Because of this rule, I was forced to pick up my little girl at 2 PM before the other after-school pick-ups I needed to make, thus reducing the amount of time she was spending at Scottsdale Academy. They would do nothing to modify their fees to compensate for this, and were completely unwilling to make adjustments based on actual hourly attendance. It's as if they do not want your business!  Interesting business model - I imagine attrition is high at this school. I know I was only too happy to withdraw my child. (By the way, they don't refund any of your money when you withdraw.)\\n\\n4) Communication Problems\\nThe daycare workers at Scottsdale Academy do not communicate with parents about the daily experiences/progress of their children. A slip of paper is provided at the end of the day telling parents that the child napped or did not, ate or did not, and what project was completed. No other information is shared - nothing about social interactions, milestones, problems, or other pertinent issues. When I arrived to pick up my child, everyone there acted as if they were too busy to stop and talk to me.\n",

The menu is a bit too \\\"American\\\" for me; if you expect a truly authentic experience, this is not the place.  I think they get a lot of tourists here, who are used to the more Americanized dishes.  \\n\\nTo start, the salsa is extremely tasty - very fresh - although the chips seemed \\\"bag\\\" quality.  After that, it was all downhill.  Two stars is a gift - it's closer to 1 star.  For lunch, we had the machaca - dry, shredded beef with peppers and tomatoes, and a combo plate of chile relleno and a corn tamale.  The plates look like a disaster when served; sauce everywhere, very disorganized.  The plates came out so hot they must have been microwaved - not a good sign at a respectable restaurant.  Too much sauce, also a sign of laziness and lack of attention to detail.  The rice was not great - not made fresh, and also crisp on top from the microwave (or taken from yesterday's rice pot).  The refried beans were a flavorless mash of canned beans; avoid.  The machaca shredded meat itself was somewhat flavorful, but again it appeared that they make it day(s) earlier and then re-heat it after slapping it on a plate.  Not authentic. The flour tortilla was huge and actually the best thing I tasted, other than the salsa.  Americanized, large plates of re-heated slop.  My advice - find a REAL Mexican restaurant, and stay away from this joint.\n",

      "Review :  I very rarely complain about the food at restaurants, but I was shocked by how much I disliked the buffet at the Flamingo. Usually I've got to the pricier buffets when I've been in Vegas, and always liked them, but we decided to look at something a little cheaper to make up for our other expensive meals of the weekend, and found ourselves at Flamingo. \\n\\nThe food wasn't very fresh. Nothing was warm or cold - just a lukewarm temperature. We tried the spring rolls, several of the vegetable dishes, fried rice, shrimp, cocktail sauce, crab legs, salads, desserts... basically gave everything a try. The spring rolls and crackers were chewy, while all the sauces were inedible. The cocktail sauce had such a strong horseradish taste that I nearly choked on it, and I'm not sure what was in the Caesar dressing but it was awful and had a weird, gritty texture (almost like sand). My dining partner said the desserts were very good. \\n\\nThe saving grace for dinner was the make your own pasta bar. It was something that I easily could have made at home, but it was fresh, tasty, and the only reason that I left feeling full. \\n\\nThe service was also very friendly and helpful, but with food like that I'd rather spend the extra money to go to the Buffet at the Aria.\n",

      "Review :  Total RIP OFF. I went into the store for a price quote on a new motor and some replacement cartridges and they gave me a reasonable price but when I called them to come out to do the work they charged me an extra  15% on the cartridges then what they had quoted they would cost. The repair man also did not bring the replacement motor that was ordered so he could charge me for an extra 45 minutes while he drove back to the store to get the motor he had forgotten. I was also told that the new motor would come with a new pump housing in the original quote which it did not. When I called to ask the manager about the pricing he was immediately standoffish and hostile. I couldn't believe that they treat their customers this poorly. The repairman had done about  25 minutes  of work and they charged me 210.00 dollars in labor alone not to mention a price increase of about 15% for all the parts quoted. For about 50 more bucks I could have replaced the entire system. I would advise anyone looking to have their pool serviced to go else where and avoid this dishonest company.\n",

The club has 3 floors-smoking is permitted at the bar area of the 1st or 2nd floor. I didn't like the way you had to walk up what looks like emergency stairwells to get from level to level--annoying!

I've stayed in motels that were cleaner and better appointed.\\n\\nI could have done without the Sleep Number bed, but that's probably more of a personal preference than anything. However, it appeared to me that the money would have been better spent on updating the rooms themselves. Apparently it used to be a Marriott some time ago - I'm guessing they decided to drop the brand rather than update to Marriott's standards.\\n\\nThe continental breakfast was a crime. $12 for buffet style eggs (from a bag no less), sausage, french toast, and oily potato cubes they were trying to say were home fries is unconscionable. Passing on this gastronomic atrocity, I decided to invest my money in an english muffin and two 4 oz. yogurts (only option is Strawberry Banana?

We love the location, the casino, the Starbucks inside- everything.\\n\\nChecking in has never been the most hospitable part of the trip. We understand that they're trying to get a bunch of people checked in and out simultaneously, and we don't mind waiting in the long line.\\n\\nWe booked our trip long before the 3PM check-in time rule, and we arrived at 8 in the morning. I asked the Manager how I might be able to pay the extra $25 dollars to check in early, and he quite rudely told me that I just couldn't check in until later. He then told me that we had to leave the lobby, and take our luggage out of it. When I asked another person what was going on, she begged me to please get my luggage out of the lobby before her Manager had a talk with her about it.\\n\\nWhen we were finally able to check in at 10AM, I commented on how rude the Manager was (and that everyone else was nice) and she looked worried that he might overhear me. He stood in the background frowning and shaking his head \\\"no\\\" the entire 20 minutes we waited in the express check-in line.\\n\\nI HATE IT WHEN EMPLOYEES ARE SCARED OF THEIR BOSSES- this is not the way to manage staff. This is unprofessional, and does not give the customer a very good impression of how things are run.\\n\\nPlus- the pool is a miserly little pad of water, and all of the chairs are chained together in these creepy rows. It's just not aesthetic or comfortable to sunbathe so close to strangers. Every other hotel on the strip has a much better family-friendly pool, even the Flamingo or the Monte Carlo!\\n\\nWe have just booked another trip, and we're going to stay elsewhere, until we hear they've gotten their acts together.\n",

Before our trip, I went online and searched for all the must-do & bargain deals that Vegas offered.  Luv-It Frozen Custard was recommended.  I'd have to say that even before our trip began, I was more looking forward to going to this place than going anywhere else because I LOVE frozen treats.  We couldn't go during the first two days but on the third, when my husband found out that there was a Star Trek convention at the Hilton Hotel, I waved goodbye to him and eagerly made my way to this place.  In my mind, I was going to get Cold Stones portion of the most savory custard and I wasn't going to have to share any of it with my husband...\\nWell, when I rounded the corner to this place, I knew I might be in for a let down...just the ambiance of the surrounding neighborhood.  I actually missed the store and had to turn around.  \\nWhen I finally got to the parking area, I was surprised because I thought it was a shop that I would be able to walk in to, see the various custards, and pick the one that I wanted.  Instead, I was faced with just a guy hanging his head out the window, asking me what I would like.  \\nI ended up getting chocolate chip.  I was unimpressed.  I thought it would come in a cone but he gave me a scoop of it in a styrofoam cup.   The portions were so tiny!  The size...not what I imagined.  The taste...also not what I imagined.  It was like eating soft ice cream.  The price...EQUALLY unimpressive.  How can you call a scoop of ice cream for about $5(?) cheap?  \\nI tell you, this place IS NOT a hidden gem.  It may be hidden but it's no gem.  You'll be better off getting your frozen treat from somewhere else like Jean Philippe Patisserie at Bellagio.  You're spending about the same amount of money for more gelato, and you'll get to enjoy it at the Bellagio!  (((I love Bellagio...)))\\nAfter the convention, my husband asked me if I wanted to go to Luv-It's now, not knowing that I went without him...I said NO! \\nI'm telling you, save your money!

      "Review :  I've been patronizing Mimi's for over 30 years and I am sad to report that they have finally reached their lowest point, at least at this location.  I have always been a BIG fan of Mimi's but this latest visit for a late breakfast on a Sunday morning was the most disappointing visit ever.  After almost a 20 minute wait we were finally seated even though the restaurant did not appear to be full.  The young girls who were taking names and seating customers didn't seem to know what they were doing.  Despite giving us one of those ridiculous vibrating devices with flashing red lights, they came outside at least twice looking for someone they could not find.  \\n\\nThe biggest disappointment was the cost of our breakfast dishes for what we received.  We each ordered a mimosa with a low end sparkling wine which cost almost $8 each.  My wife ordered their bacon apple waffles which were very good and tasty but there were only 3 tiny waffles about the diameter of a tennis ball . . . completely bare and accompanied by the tiny cup of syrup with chopped apples and bacon bits.  I have a French variation of eggs Benedict which was also pretty tasty but pricey for two small poached eggs on some seasoned mashed potatoes and spinach.\\n\\nOur server was efficient but somewhat intense and not very personable.  Even the carpet in the dining area appeared dirty and unkempt.  Just not a great experience.  Probably won't return to ANY Mimi's for some time because they have definitely lost their edge and reputation as an upscale value chain restaurant.\\n\\nAlthough I am a budding senior citizen (my wife is NOT) I'm beginning to feel out of place at Mimi's which is often populated by a sea of white hairs and snow birds who don't seem to mind their mediocre, high priced fare set in a sort of Disneyesque French atmosphere.  It just doesn't resonate with me anymore and it doesn't feel at all upscale middle of the road like it used when they first opened restaurants in So Cal where I used to live.\n",

We were both in the mood for trying some tasty dim sum and it sounded like a good idea... until we got here. We grabbed a couple of dishes to start. It doesn't matter what they were cause here is what is important they were all cold, stale, and didn't even appear appetizing. Needless to say, we didn't grab anything else. Oh and the worst part, as soon as I got home I felt stomach sick and had to throw up. That never happens.

Red Robin used to be a fun family place, then they tried to make it upscale and got rid of the games, kids coloring pages, large balloons, fun posters etc....  I've never thought the food was that great, but the shakes are awesome and the kids used to like it. Going in there now is the utmost test in patience and tolerance.  The service is horrible (more because they seem understaffed than because the servers are inept), and there are fewer menu options and higher prices.  The number of kids in there and the noise level will drive you to drink; but not there, because the glasses are dirty and the manager will tell you that boogers on the glasses are just scratches.  Oh, and the bathroom is disgusting. If there is no soap and the trash is overflowing, then I'm not sure any of the employees are going in there let alone washing their hands.  In my opinion, Red Robin turned their backs on their customer base by trying to upgrade and make it more adult. I would never go there with all adults and it's not really fun for kids anymore.

Some really weird icky smell was in the air too..?\\nInside is cramped with little orange tables, totally kitsch and cute. The staff were all very friendly and made sure our orders were taken as soon as we were ready, even to the point that different waitresses were asking to make sure we had coffee on the way.\\nThe coffee's great and I was impressed with raw sugar on each table. \\n\\nThe menu is small [literally] and I ordered the cheese omelette [cheddar] with mushrooms and hash browns. The hash browns were ridiculously oily. They would have been tastier without so much grease. The omelette was mediocre and I could have made the same in my own kitchen.  The whole wheat toast was probably the best part of the meal, and the jam tasted homemade and flavourful. I am not used to really greasy food like I was served [nor did I expect it] and therefore could not get through half my breakfast before my stomach started aching. \\n\\nThe jist?

      "Review :  I love to cook. I go to new restaurants all the time to get inspiration for new things to try in my own kitchen. I didn't get much from Tommy Bahama's Scottsdale restaurant. We arrived for our reservation a few minutes early, checked in with the hostess, and my companion was escorted to the upstairs dining room while I parked the car. I joined her shortly and found that she had been seated in the walled \\\"back\\\" part of the dining room, that frankly looks like an afterthought to the much more pleasant and amply windowed main area. Not much of a view from here. But, the decor was very pleasant, and we set about ordering lunch.\\n\\nFirst, we had Tommy's Coconut Shrimp appetizer, billed as \\\"World Famous\\\". Nicely presented, crispy coconut, and a slightly too sweet papaya-mango chutney dipping sauce accompanied four good size, juicy shrimp. A good start! For lunch, we ordered the BBQ pork Habana Cabana sandwich and the South Beach Cuban sandwich.\\n\\nWhen the Cuban sandwich arrived, it was accompanied by a \\\"slaw\\\" of sorts that included chunks of orange, and slices of fennel bulb in a non-descript dressing. The combination of anise and orange just didn't work for me. Besides, the fennel was sliced across the width of the bulb, making relatively large  horseshoe shaped strips that were difficult to spear on the fork and even harder to fit in my mouth gracefully without cutting them individually. The Cuban sandwich was totally unimaginative. The \\\"roasted pork tenderloin\\\" looked to be the identical shredded pork that was the basis of my companion's BBQ pork sandwich minus the BBQ sauce and was somewhat dry. A few slices of what looked and tasted like supermarket deli ham were layered with some cheese and a big slice of sour pickle on a diagonally cut bun that was soggy from the ham inside and crunchy dry on the outside. \\n\\nMy companion's BBQ sandwich had an ample amount of shredded pork that had apparently been tossed in a thick dark sauce and piled on a nicely toasted round bun. Plain French fries accompanied the sandwich. On first bite, she immediately commented on how overly sweet the sauce was, so I tasted a little sample and had to agree. No offsetting acidity to the sugary blackberry brandy BBQ sauce that smothered the meat. Too bad too, because it mostly covered up the flavor of what appeared to be  a nice smoky meat and left a sticky sweet aftertaste instead of nice smoky BBQ.\\n\\nOur server was friendly, personable, and efficient. The food runner took away or forks as he cleared the appetizer plates and delivered the sandwiches, but did not come with new, so we had to flag down our server and wait for forks as lunch cooled. All-in-all, it wasn't the kind of lunch experience I expected for nearly $60 (no alcohol) including tip. Great location, lovely decor, but missing some really important points when it comes to the total experience. Lastly, for whatever reason, they subsequently reported us to Open Table as a \\\"no-show\\\". Nice.\n",

The area in the front entrance was nice looking with the statues and water. The food court was great and we enjoyed the Bodies and Titanic exhibits which I defiantly recommend! The folks at the mLife counter were super helpful!\\n\\nTHE BAD: everything else! The timeshare creepers who kept stopping us EVERYTIME we walked by even without me making eye contact. Just stop!

The internet part sucked considering I needed wifi for my iphone so all weekend it was hard to pick up a decent signal. Also there was no coffee pot or mini fridge which can be found in you average Marriott hotel nowadays, but for a luxury hotel on the strip... I guess those were not considered basic needs which caused us to eat at their food court and spend even more money.\\n\\nTHE UGLY: the elevator was horrible. It was very rickety and caused my husband and I to topple into other people while in there. The back door of our hotel bathroom was covered with dark finger smudges and a few red smears of goodness knows what. I had to wipe the door down before I felt clean enough to use it. Our room towels were really grungy and needed to be replaced. My husband forgot a comb so we called the front desk and they directed us to their 24/7 store where we HAD to buy one at $5.

      "Review :  This is absolutely not a 4 star hotel like they pretend it is on all the travel sites. Believe me. It's 2 star if anything. The rooms are extremely small and not very clean. I stayed there for 4 nights and the bedding was NOT washed once. They are cheap with the towels (you have to ask the front desk for an extra towel for the pool for example because you only get 1 or 2 towels in general for your room...the whole time). The walls are paper thin, everything looks aged (and not in a quirky way, in an outdated sad way) and the staff seems aggravated constantly. The only good thing about the hotel was the pool but even then that's not saying much at all.\\n\\nI do not recommend this place at all. It's nice to save a buck on travel accommodations but Montreal has many other hotels that are far better than this one.\n",

When I think of real Fish and Chips, I think of what I had in London. This isn't what I had in London. This is what I ate in college during lent--store bought cheap fish patties.

      "Review :  The night started off well - we purchased the wrist bands for $100 to have unlimited well drinks and were immediately impressed with the side acts happening - almost circus like and very entertaining.  After about 1 1/2 hours at the club, we had just finished watching an act and a bouncer turned to me and said \\\"time to call it a night.\\\"  I was very confused, because while I had finished three drinks, I was certainly not drunk on any \\\"getting kicked out of the bar\\\" level.  I tried to get clarification and he pointed at my girlfriend and said \\\"she was swaying.\\\"  I thought he was kidding - she hadn't had any more to drink than me - and if she was swaying it was just enjoying the music - and furthermore, if she was the one getting kicked out, why would they tell me to be calling it a night?  It didn't make any sense.  They would just go to her and kick her out - but somehow, they knew we were together and made a point to kick us out together.  This was all before 1am.  \\n\\nAfter assessing our situation and trying to coordinate with the others in our group that were still in the club, I returned one more time to try and ask some questions.  I was completely respectful and just said I didn't understand.  The bouncer got a puffed up, crossed his arms and said it didn't matter why he kicked us out, he could do whatever he wanted - it was private property.  He said if he came to my house and I told him to leave he would have to go - same here.  \\n\\nExcept we paid money to go into the club, and were dismissed before we were able to really even take advantage of it.  If you ask me, it's a brilliant business model - charge people the $100 for drinking and  then kick them out before they can use it.  \\n\\nThere is no explanation for what happened.  We've been trying to figure out if they were just trying to make more room for other people - single people who might spend more money, or if they truly are taking advantage of that arm band and making money off of it.  We certainly weren't drunk enough or behaving in any way to merit it.  \\n\\nI've sent an email and am awaiting a response.  \\n\\nI've never been kicked out of a bar or club before, have always been respectful, and even in this situation, I never raised my voice or caused a problem.  But it ruined our night - I couldn't stop thinking about it and trying to figure out what happened.  \\n\\nAs far as I'm concerned, they owe me $100 and an apology.  And if you do go, don't buy the wrist band or any deals - they'll just take advantage of you.\n",

His response was that I was suppose to realize even though he told me during the process it was coming any day.three times ..I was suppose to know that appraisals take time and  5 weeks was normal..   not once  prior to receiving it ...did he ever tell me ..it would take anywhere near 5 weeks... Mr perry lives in his own world...  ask others...and real other reviews...I smiled when reading some of the negative ones. It seems so real to me...\\n\\nBut heres the kicker...Mr Perry knows that they have some kind of deal where they must take back and or exchange for paintings similar in prices..honestly i cant remember because it was  a while ago...but they tekl you something comforting when you buy the painting....   So instead of ever being in a situation that the prices I was sold cant be reasonably achieved .... Mr Perry chose..totally out of the blue... to tell me he no longer will do business with me.. \\n\\n\\nBe careful big buyers...if this is how they treated me...then wow  what about  you guys..  its been a while since this happened ,...but when i read some of the other buyers reviews I felt it was good for others to beware!!!

So we get there at 9 and no one was there. We then called their other office to see when they would open and they said they had no idea when someone would be there. Are you kidding me?

Once we placed our drink orders, it was about a half hour before any of them came. In fact, they came AFTER some of the appetizers. Entrees came after awhile also, but no appetizer plates were cleared so there was no room on the table. Some peoples' sides were incorrect, but the food was great so we tried to power through.

But the pecan crust and balsamic drizzle were tasty.  The spinach was sauteed in (what seemed like) the equivalent of an entire tub of margarine.  I had to put a paper drink napkin under the spinach to try to soak up some of the margarine...a completely drenched napkin later, I sill had margarine spinach.  For the cost of the amount of margarine used they could have used a teaspoon of REAL butter.  The red potatoes I was expecting were home fries (breakfast potatoes).  My husband's Cajun chicken sandwich was as he described, they driest sandwich he'd ever eaten.  The potato salad that came with the sandwich was amazing, however.  For dessert, creme brulee, which the menu indicated as a restaurant favorite.  Hmm, it was more eggy than creme brulee should be, and was left unfinished--a rare occurrence in our history of encounters with this tasty dessert!  The service was also very slow and inconsistent.  The table next to us ordered a cup of soup right after us and got it 10 minuets before us.\\n\\nFrom the other Yelp reviews it seems better to stick to traditional bar food--basically stay away from the second half of the dinner menu.\n",

      "Review :  Soooo disappointed!! \\n\\nI stayed 2 nights at the belle suite for my bachlorette and it was a bad experience from day one. I don't even know where to start... \\n\\n1. The service was horrible!! It took them almost 1 1/2 hours to bring us fresh towels and 35 minutes for more toilet paper, not to mention they only brought one roll for a group of people in a suite!!!! I had to go find a cleaning lady because it took to damn long. \\n\\n2. Rude! Rude! Rude Security! My friend forgot her room key and she asked if he could page someone to let her up and he said \\\"don't you see I'm dealing with more important stuff\\\", as if the other guest was more important than her. \\n\\n3. We had noooo signal for Internet at all and no phone service at all either \\n\\n4. Our room keys kept getting inactivated so we had to walk EVERYTIME downstairs for replacement keys\\n\\n5. There was a puddle of water on the floor which made me almost fall!\\n\\n6. We checked out at 10:50 and asked for bell hop and he arrived at 11:45! I understand they are busy but really almost an hour for a bellhop!?\\n\\nI would have rather stayed at a motel 6 because I feel that it is the type of service I paid for. I will never stay there again. Beautiful interior but even the room didn't seem worth the price. I paid too much for a horrible hotel experience.\n",

      "Review :  I've eaten here a few times now and the foods is good, but VERY spicy.  This time I decided it's too spicy to really enjoy.  Also, the service wasn't that great this time. We had a party of 6 and sat in the front bar area by the window. I had to ask for drinks, water and to place our order. finally another server came so the service improved 1/2 way through.  One of the couples had never been, she ordered the shrimp dish with rice and cheese. It's a $15 dollar dish and only got 4 shrimp.  And she didn't care much for it. \\nBut the highlight was a cockroach running around under our table.  I had to go get staff to take care of that.\\nI realize most restaurants have them, ya just don't see them. But that kinda ruined it for me along with the spiciness.\\nOne more thing, the music was high energy like dance club and loud. And it was early, about 530 on a Saturday.\n",

      "Review :  This place has thousands of reviews and Yelpers seem to like it. But I just don't get it. We checked reviews before going so we were expecting something good, at least better than Quiznos, which it is not. I am guessing that people like it because it is a cheap option compared to other prices on the strip. But for my money, Quznos is better. Even Subway. Jersey Mike's leaves this place in the dust. \\n\\nI got the jerk chicken sandwich and not only was the sandwich small, and I mean really, really small, but there was hardly any chicken and although tender, it was not jerk. I also got chicken noodle soup and for $3.49 the tiny little container was a total ripoff. Plus, the soup was bland bland bland. It was by far the worst chicken soup I have ever had. I left no less hungry than when I arrived. \\n\\nThe wife opted for oatmeal, and it was instant from a package. The only saving grace was the banana nut muffin, which appeared to be homemade.\\n\\nThe entire ordering process is chaotic and confusing. You can order some things at the order station but most of our order had to picked up along the line, which led to massive confusion when it came time to pay, so I ended up with three receipts. \\n\\nOverall, I cannot imagine how anyone can go above 3 stars for this place. I could give it 3 because of the muffin, but in reality my sandwich and soup were 2 star quality and the overall experience was not pleasant.\\n\\nWould not return for anything.\n",

I usually survey restaurants too, and didn't see a single mexican person which threw me off. I mean the place does not need to be littered with a particular race but if the food is authentic and good then usually mexicans will frequent the place.

I ordered the green chicken enchiladas and they tasted so sweet..I mean I prefer spicy mexican food..not sweet mexican food.

The associates were all very friendly, minus a little Miss Mindy. And it just so happens she was the one to help me with my transaction. She was rude (\\\"Well, I told you the iPhone would come out to $88 after taxes before I went to the back to get it!\\\"), degrading (\\\"Why do you want International access? You wanna call Mexico or something?\\\"), and bossy (\\\"Don't touch that or the security sensor will go off.\\\") Well, my dear, that is what you are there for. In the event that the alarm goes off on one of your non-operable display phones, those little keys you keep around your wrist on the spiral chain to make yourself look important are used to stop the alarm. I truly hope a manager reads posted reviews regarding their stores, because Miss Mindy needs ettiquette classes.

      "Review :  Okay, I want to like it more than I do but.....well, lets just dig into the review. First, know that I went there for lunch on a Saturday, not in the evening when it is in full swing, so maybe I missed part of the ambiance but honestly, I went there to try the food. \\n\\nFirst, I had the olives appetizer and based just on that, this place would be amazing. It was a small plate full of big, meaty, green olives, obviously warmed in a bath of live oil and served with a light sprinkle of salt and oh, so good. I would go back just for these. But, an appetizer does not a meal make so lets go on to the main course and side dish. \\n\\nFor lunch I had some sort of pasta which was advertised to have anchovies, lemon, and if i remember correctly, hot pepper. I also ordered a side of braised greens. The pasta, when it was served, came in a large white bowl and honestly, when I order a pasta dish over $10, I prefer it to be well...plated, on a plate. The dish also contained sauteed fennel which, while not unpleasant, was not expected, and it seemed, it was a bit dry. As for the braised greens, also served in a large white bowl and that was it, just the braised greens. Some cracked black pepper and some shaving of hard cheese, would definitely have helped round out the side dish (though at $3 I can't complain too much but make it $4 and bump it up a bit). \\n\\nFinally, the decor, nothing really stands out. Sen, right next door, has much more of an artistic edge so maybe they could kick up the look of the place a bit. So, take the review for what it is and if nothing else, go in the evening for a glass of wine and the olive appetizer (a steal at $5) but overall, it did not wow me as much as I expected from all the write-ups.\n",

When I got there the receptionist said the stylist had just run to Starbucks. \\nWhen she walked in, she said, \\\"Is this it?\\\" (Meaning her appointment) and the receptionist said yes. First of all, THIS???  Is this it?

Of course because it is in Las Vegas there are many better options if you take a minute to look.\\n\\nLate at night though you should avoid this place.  We had walked by many times.  They are always playing good music and the energy seems good.  We finally went in and found that inside was a different story.  The crowd is a little lacking and the environment reminds you of spring break.  That is probably a good thing for some,  but not me.\\n\\nIt is tempting to stop in because you do not have the lines or high cover charges of Las Vegas clubs, but you will find that maybe the charge and wait are worth it.\n",

I was there tonight with some friends for a birthday and I can honestly say that it was the worst service that I've ever seen. The waitress never came around to check on us, maybe every 40 minutes or so. So instead of ordering our drinks from her, we tried the bar, which was just as bad. Two of us were standing at the bar for around 30 minutes and never had a bartender get our drinks, so I just left. It was ridiculous to say the least. We were supposed to be going there next weekend for a bachelorette party and we will now be taking our service elsewhere.\n",

This market seems to attract a lot of people.\\n\\nI was very disappointed once I started looking more closely at the products. The market sells produce that you would find at a grocery store (perhaps slightly lower prices due to difference in overhead). I talked to one of the workers there and he said that they do not carry organic or local products (with the exception of some local Carolina strawberries that day). However, he said to check back in a month because they may start carrying some local types of products. \\n\\nI want to support local growers and sustainable practices by shopping at Farmers Markets. I do not plan on returning here when I can buy the same produce at a local grocery store. However, if you enjoy shopping outdoors and it encourages you to eat more fruits and veggies, this would be a nice experience.\n",

While the chips and salsa are good and served in a unique way, this may be the highlight of the night.  The food is expensive, and really not that great.  The margaritas are way too sweet, and the number of tequilas you can order is very limited for a place that serves Mexican Food.

I didn't even get past the hostess stand at Customshop and I'm not sure that I will ever be back to try again.  \\n\\nWe've been talking about giving Customshop a try for a while now and decided last week to go for dinner while we were in the area.  Considering that it was 7:30 on a Friday and we had no reservation, our hopes weren't high that we'd get a seat, but it never hurts to try.  As expected, there were no available tables.  No big deal.  Like I said, it was expected.  \\n\\nHere's the problem:  don't talk about what you can't do for me  right in front of me.  Step away from the hostess stand, study your table map, confer with each other, pretend that you're trying to find a table for me--you know me, the guy who pays your salary?--pretend that you actually care.  Instead, a scowling and apparently harried waiter shot down every idea that the two slightly more--though not completely--helpful hostesses presented him with.  Poor form, indeed.  If this is the type of servers that are hired to work here, I'm glad that I didn't have to endure it for an entire meal.  \\n\\nWhat restaurant managers and owners need to understand is that uniqueness does not reign in Charlotte.

When we finally decided to try it on a Saturday morning I was definitely not as enamored with the place as he was. \\n\\nI don't know if I was expecting the place to be different just because I was there for breakfast but this place is totally a bar that is trying its hand at breakfast as well.  I mean I had been there for drinks a few times but I somehow expected a different vibe when we went for breakfast.  My wish was not fulfilled.  Instead I was led to a sticky, lopsided table with a waitress that look like she'd been working there for 45 years.  None of that matters much right? Well it wouldn't if the food was superb.  But it wasn't.\\n\\nThe place is mediocre at best.  They love oil and make you well aware of it.  The first time I visited here I ordered the walleye with toast.  I know that it is not typical breakfast fare but I love me some walleye.  Anyway, got the walleye, tried the walleye, but didn't like the walleye.  It was oily as all get out and one side was burned.  The toast was slathered in butter, yuck.  My over easy eggs were simply just gross.  They were really watery and completely inedible.\\n\\nBut what do you do when you have a meal like that?  You go back to try it again.  I went back to try the pancakes that the man said were the best pancakes he ever had.  I ordered them with the walleye (again), along with the potatoes.

Give Postino Central time to hire a service focused staff with a sense of urgency before you come here. \\n\\nThe arrival of Postino in my 'hood was highly anticipated.  I was hoping the new \\\"central\\\" location would be \\\"inspired\\\" by Postino... not an Exact replica.. Which was a little boring!  We arrived at 7:30 to a full bar.. Which, a full bar is nothing new for this restaurant group, so why did it seem so chaotic? \\n\\nWe found some seats at the bar and waited to be served... and waited... and waited... we counted 3-4 on bar staff... yet the \\\"main'\\\" bartender seemed pre-occupied, and easily distracted.. AHAD?  We were finally acknowledged after 10 mins and placed our orders. \\n\\n As we looked around, we noticed others at the bar with either an empty drink or no drink at all. (Amazing that the owner was monitoring the restaurant, however did not pick up on the fact so many at the bar had to wait so long for service) \\n\\nThere was one lucky group at the bar, ( We think they were the original cast from  the movie Sixteen Candles  ) that enjoyed exceptional service and attention.. Full drinks at all times, maintaining the bartender's attention as the rest of the patrons suffered.  Perhaps they hypnotized or used voodoo on the staff... Hey ...whatever it takes... I guess I'll go to a graveyard and kill a chicken at midnight before my next visit! \\n\\nThe bruschetta we ordered was great, the same quality as the Campbell location.  Warm, thickly sliced artisan bread, covered with generous amounts of toppings.  Our favorites were the prosciutto, Fig and mascarpone cheese and the Apple & Brie.. yummy!!!  The food was the only reason I gave this night a 2 star.  \\n\\nAlthough we fought our better judgment to leave after we enjoyed  our food... we stayed.  Big mistake!  We foolishly thought  once Jake Ryan and Caroline Mulford left the bar , the voodoo spell would be broken, that was not the case...the wait for the following drinks were just as lengthy as the first!\\n\\nIf I were the owner, .. I'd replace the Bar Staff with the Valet Staff.. The Valet Staff was quicker, service focused  and had more personality then anyone at the bar..\\n\\nI look forward to returning back to Postino Central when they have \\\"ironed out\\\" the \\\"kinks\\\"..\n",

The patio was almost full but not out of control.  \\n\\nAfter about 10 minutes the hostess asked us if we would like a drink and if we would be more comfortable at our table.

About 20 minutes later a server came by with the bottle, the bottle was corked, not all that uncommon, I ordered another bottle and was brought 10 minutes later, the wine was fine, we asked if we could place our food order, we had already been sitting at the table for more than an hour at this point.  He said \\\"I will be back in 30 seconds\\\", about five minutes later he came back to take our order.

      "Review :  If I could give this place negative stars I would. Years ago, there was an incident where they messed up our order, and instead of fixing the issue and having the driver come back with the right order I was told by the owner, \\\"We are too busy tough luck.\\\" I can not make this up. He then called me sweat heart which I felt was very demeaning and sexist, so I called him an ass. Years later....years later, my boyfriend places an order and is told that we can not place one over the phone. He was told the only way they would take the order is if he placed it in the restaurant, according to the woman on the phone she said that is what the \\\"note\\\" on the account said. I find that to be disturbing, why the hell does he need to go there, did they want to confront him? Also? They litter, horribly. I see their pieces of wasted paper all over where I work and live.  Obviously, they don't care about their reviews either. This place needs to be shut down, anyone reading this...please don't give them your business and hopefully they have to close shop.\n",

      "Review :  I booked a package deal and selected Luxor since it was one of the lowest priced deals. Since i had never stayed there,  I thought I'd give it a try.  Check in was fairly easy. They don't seem so friendly with the guests but that part was alright. My non-smoking room on the 19th floor smelled like a mild cigar. The bathroom and beds seemed really clean.  I actually only have two things that were deal breakers for me: \\n\\n1) it's a bit too far from the middle of the strip so it isn't the most convenient if you like to go down to the Miracle Mall shops and Bellagio/Ceasar's Palace. Very limited places to eat (with any decent reviews) without having a walk a ways,  \\n\\n2) The air conditioner had a problem during the day keeping it cool in the room due to the glass windows. It seemed the room was probably about 80 degrees inside. I must say it was 100 degrees outside but I need a more comfortable room when it comes to AC.  The room seemed to get somewhat comfortable around 3am.\\n\\nThey do have the Titanic exhibit at the Luxor.  I don't plan to go back to the Luxor.\n",

I had done some research reading reviews on Yelp and figured \\\"What the hell!\\\"\\n\\nIt was more like \\\"What the hell?!\\\"\\n\\nI would have to disagree with some of the other reviews here on Yelp. Hot n Juicy is far superior in quality and taste. We typically order crawfish, clams and king crab when we go to Hot n Juicy. It was a bummer that Cravin' Cajun didn't have any clams on that particular night. Next, they only have 2 flavors: Lemon Pepper and their Cravin' Cajun house sauce. I didn't get the punch in the tastebuds effect here as I do at Hot n Juicy. The spiciness is pretty wicked. Can't complain there.\\n\\nThe service was very good. We were seated promptly (it was pretty empty with about only 6-7 tables being served), didn't wait too long for our food to come and our water cups were constantly filled. Sad to say, the great service wasn't enough to compensate for the mediocre food.

      "Review :  I've hesitated to write about Fate. I always enjoyed the food and experience at the owner's old Lucky Dragon, even back when it was on University. I also appreciate the fact that Fate is a downtown pioneer, and that one can eat there after 9:00.\\n\\nWe've been to Fate a number of times, with vaguely disappointing results. After this visit -- we've had it. \\n\\nI'm not really high on the \\\"this happened when i went there one time so it must happen all the time\\\" style of user review. So, let me state that everything that happened on this visit has also happened during previous visits, yet never all at once. Fate, however, put it all together this time to deliver a really memorable fiasco. \\n\\nI don't know if Fate's policy is to have the hostess/host inform everyone waiting for a table that the wait is going to be fifteen minutes, but the math doesn't work out. The place is tiny. We waited forty minutes. The next group waited fifty-five minutes. The next few groups are probably still waiting, their once-vital bodies deteriorating into skeletons.\\n\\nThe server dropped off some menus, mentioned that she was going to bring us some water, and then vanished as if she were an illusionist's assistant. Again, Fate is tiny, so the trick was pretty difficult.\\n\\nAnyway, we ordered after she rematerialized (after the required fifteen minutes). Stuff arrived. It was the old joke -- \\\"the food here is terrible... and such small portions!\\\"\\n\\nI'll spare most of the hideous details, but one lowlight to share involved the sesame/shrimp/salad item. I'm hoping that the foul flavor and aroma was the result of some slightly-off fish sauce, rather than some slightly-off shrimp. Actually, why do I care? We felt lousy afterwards and dosed up on the twin antidotes of water and mouthwash. Our cat still wouldn't come near us. \\n\\nAnyway, I don't mean to imply that the owner and staff at Fate are malicious. The food isn't good enough, and the experience isn't good enough. Oh, if you're uncomfortable with IKEA furnishings (I'm fine), don't even try it.\n",

      "Review :  Stopped in here after refusing to wait for Guadalajara and Gallo blancos wait times on a labor day weekend. We tried this place after passing by it twice. What the hell why not. Got inside and the atmosphere was less than desirable, felt like I was at work in a warehouse with shitty ventilation. Chips and salsa arrived, half chips half crumbs, and the salsa appeared to be a bowl of canned stewed tomatos, which in my mind trying to figure out how to dip this chip into this thick salsa that looks like it's just chunks of tomato. So the entrees come and our waitress as serving us spills hot water off one of the plates on my girl, and doesn't come back with any towel or ice, while my girl believes it was accidental, I think waitress did it on purpose because my girl appears to be a snobby bitch all the time. (She can't help it, it's just the way she comes off)  so while enjoying our entrees, yup I said enjoying, it wasn't all bad food was okay except the enchiladas, the tortillas seemed stale like the plate was made 2 days ago and reheated just for me. The ticker was when were watching the game 2 angry roaches came out of no where fussing and arguing about who was gonna win the game, not bugging any one else while they did their debate (ha I said not bugging any one) my girl whose got a serious disgust and fear of roaches fled the restaurant and waited in the car on this 100+  degree that day. Cashier was curious about the situation and took care of us otherwise after explaining what happened. That would be my last time visiting, wondering what the roaches do while they aren't fighting over sports, probably using huge chunks of tomatos to float on in the thick salsa to keep cool while inside.\n",

Which is no problem to me bc I am a waitress as well and I know sometimes 1 server can handle smaller restaurants when it's not during peak hours. But wow, was I wrong. Our female server just did everything sooooo slow. She took our drinks late, our order late, everything. The way she prioritized the order of the things she needs to do was just terrible. Halfway through my meal (bacon slam burger & chicken tenders were delicious tho! Thanks to the cook), I needed another sauce of honey mustard. She only checked on our table ONCE and I asked for my extra cup of honey mustard & refills for our waters. Then she goes to the register to process a LARGE party who has multiple checks first before she gets us our simple water refills & sauce. That took about 15 mins, so by the time she came back w/ our stuff, my chicken tenders were cold already and my 2 other friends has already finished their meals (lumberjack slam & Belgian waffle slam).

My wife and I decided on Elements (at The Sanctuary) for our anniversary after narrowing down our top 3 choices of highly-rated restaurants...anticipating it would be a special experience. I will write about the good and the bad.\\n\\nWe had reservations for 7PM.  We were told it would be a few minutes and the hostess apologized.  No problem...we went to the bar, had a cocktail, some friendly conversation with a gentleman playing in the band at the resort.  Our female bartender was very nice and attentive.  However, the few minutes turned into 45 minutes.  This is unacceptable considering we did have a reservation!  10 - 15 minutes I can understand, 45 minutes, not really.\\n\\nWe did have a great, romantic view at our table.  Our primary waiter was cordial, but appeared to be rushed and really did not take the time to review some dishes.  Not the way I would have liked to have been treated after waiting 45 minutes.\\n\\nMy appetizer, lentil soup, was excellent, unique and flavorful.  My wife raved about her oysters Rockefeller.  Her main course, was the braised short ribs which she also said were A+ in taste, texture, and tenderness.  After tasting hers, I agreed.\\n\\nHowever, I had the \\\"rack of lamb\\\", the special of the day.  Extremely disappointing.  For a \\\"rack\\\", there were only 2 very tiny ribs, one of which was just about 50% fat.  For a $40 main course and a special of the day, I was embarrassed for the restaurant.  On a positive note, the vegetables were excellent and cooked perfectly.\\n\\nBecause it was our anniversary, the restaurant delivered a complimentary, very rich, delicious chocolate peanut butter mousse with Nutella which we shared.  A very nice touch.  However, not until we had eaten most of the desert did a new female server come over and ask if we wanted coffee.  Within one minute, our primary waiter came over and asked the same.  So, I was really not impressed with the food service considering the restaurants' reputation. .\\n\\nThe car attendants were very friendly and responsive.  Overall, my wife's experience was about a 4-star.  Mine, 1.5 - 2-star.  With so many highly-rated restaurants in the Scottsdale/Paradise Valley/Phoenix area, I was deeply disappointed in my dining experience here, especially for a highly anticipated, special occasion evening.

      "Review :  I go to this location ALOT and yesterday I did not have a good experience. Grabbed a couple books and tried to find a table to sit in the cafe, but no seating area open at the moment. So I sat on a book aisle. About 20 mins later, a staff came by and told me I couldn't sit on the aisle. I told her the reason I sat on the floor was because there was no seating. Would I really want to sit on the floor unless I had to???? I didn't catch the lady's name, but she was an older lady. Must be having a bad day or something. But I ALWAYS sit on the floor when there are no seating and no one has ever told me to move. She walked over to the cafe and try to direct me over and pointed to a couple open tables. It was sort of rude, so I dropped off the books that I planned to purchase and left the store. I saw a bunch of people in each aisle standing and reading and she didn't seem to have a problem with that. I rate this location with 1 star due to the staff being rude.\n",

      "Review :  My wife and I were trying to decide what we wanted for dinner so we took a drive to downtown. As we were walking around we remember a friend recommended this place. We did not have reservation, so we went to see if they had any open tables. We got there at 6:30pm and the host said he needed to wait until 6:45 to see if any reservations did not show up. So we decided to wait. At 6:40 the host said he had a cancel. \\n\\nI like to rate my food items on a 5 star scale. The number of * is my ratings\\n\\nWhat we ordered/items came with entrees: Caesar salad*, NY Sirloin*, Tomato/ pesto stuffed chicken*, dessert plate (we did not eat any of it)\\n\\nPositives:\\nLemon sorbet that is served between the salads and entrees.\\nNo ordering of sides separately (also listed on negatives).\\nBuild your own salad tableside.\\nService for bread and water\\n\\nNegatives:\\nAtmosphere: Very dark, old feeling, and very small place. They have too many tables for the table side service for the salads and desserts. We sat at a table and when the gentleman was preparing the salads for the booths behind us he kept bumping into us.\\n\\nService: The waiter had broken English so it was hard to understand him. He did not make any recommendations. Right after we ordered the guy came to make our salads. The gentleman did not recommend any salad or describe any of the dressings. We heard him describing everything to the tables behind us after we ordered. \\n\\nFood: \\nSalads- Terrible dressing was very very fishy (anchovies).\\nEntrees- First, my steak. The steak seemed like it was from a caf\\u00e9 that serves the $1.99 steak and eggs. This was not a steak from an expensive steakhouse. My wife's chicken was something that you could also get at a cheap caf\\u00e9. \\nSides- This was very disappointing that the sides came with the entr\\u00e9e instead of us being able to order what we want. The entr\\u00e9e sides were a stuff tomato, veggies, and mashed potatoes.\\n\\nThis was the most disappointing places we have EVER been to. We have been to many expensive steakhouses and this by far is the WORST. We are locals there are many other great places to eat.\n",

Very limited selection of foods and what was on the buffet was cold and unappetizing.  Very sad excuse for a buffet brunch.  The corn muffins were dry and crunchy.  The fresh fruit on the buffet consisted of sections of red grapefruit and oranges.  There were no fresh veggies, no multigrain anything, no pasta salads, nothing at all interesting or healthy.  And the decaf coffee was horrible -- burnt tasting.  The only redeeming things were the made-to-order omelet station and the alcoholic drink that was included in the $14.99 price.

      "Review :  Wow, what a disappointment.\\n\\nMy family and I went for Thanksgiving.  The menu was set at $145 for a set five courses meaning that each course was averaging $29.  \\n\\nThe first course was a lobster salad which was decent, but nothing to write home about.  \\n\\nThe second course was 1.5-2oz of parmesan risotto.  Also good, but nothing spectacular.  \\n\\nThird course was sea bass wrapped in potato.  Inventive, but not only dry, but I was served an unacceptable piece of fish, certainly not one that should exist in a restaurant with this price structure.  \\n\\nFourth course, the supposed turkey which was an approximately 1.5\\\"x1.5\\\" square.\\nWhen I cut into it there was a huge blood vessel running through the center.  Nice. They also forgot my drizzle of sweet potato.  Additional items including a solitary piece of asparagus that had been bisected, perhaps a teaspoon of cranberry sauce, and a rolled up item I was told was a combination of dark meat and stuffing that was an measured perhaps 3/4 of an ounce.  When I told the staff of the issue with the meat requesting a new plate with a normal sized portion of turkey, sweet potatoes and asparagus guess what I got?  The same tiny portions, but at least this time the turkey was edible.  \\n\\nThe only real stand out for this meal was the last course which was a chocolate dome with hazelnut praline and icecream inside.  Hot chocolate was poured over the top to melt into the top of the dome.  Inventive and delicious.  \\n\\nThis will definitely be marked as the one Thanksgiving I had where I wasn't stuffed.\n",

It was surprisingly slow for the day but it worked out well for us because that meant lots of tables open for the 10 of us.  However the other usual perk of a slow restaurant, fast service, did not happen.

I ordered a cup of chili and my friend ordered a Chicken Caesar salad, neither of which are items that take a particularly long time to put together.  However after about 20 minutes the waitress came back, not with the food, but to ask what I wanted on top of my chili again.  It had appeared as though she wrote it down when I ordered it the 20 minutes prior but apparently looks can be deceiving.  Then it took another 5 minutes for my chili to make it's grand entrance and another 5 minutes after THAT for my friend's salad to arrive.  Now again, this place was not busy at all!  It should not take 25 minutes to scoop some chili out of a pot where it sits all day and put it into a bowl and bring it to a table.\\n\\nTo make matters worse, not only was our server slow, but every time she came around and we asked for something she acted as though we were bothering her.

      "Review :  Too bad!  After getting a Groupon for Gilbert Dogs, I went online to check out their website and Yelp reviews.  I was in.  Made an appointment for grooming and arrived on time.  Was so disappointed in the care of the business.  My first impression was, \\\"Yikes! Is this the right place?\\\"  Outside front door the sidewalk was covered in dog hair, windows were dirty with old tape on them, dirty diaper in a planter, dog poop in small island leading into the store.  That's just the outside!\\n\\nWent inside and dust, general debris and a general look of chaos.  Terrible first impression!  Young lady came out to help me, very nice and helpful but she was not the groomer.  I asked to speak to the groomer... not in yet.  Actually didn't arrive by the time I left 20 minutes later.  \\n\\nI felt so uncomfortable with the disarray and lack of cleanliness, that I changed my mind and took my papers and left... forfeiting my Groupon.  \\n\\nI don't know what the back area was like but if it was anything like the front lobby...\\n\\nI'm sure the staff has time to clean the store... remember first impressions mean EVERYTHING! (at least for me).  I won't be going back.\n",

      "Review :  This place wasn't for me - not because it wasn't nice (we got upgraded to a beautiful room), but simply because of the location. I'm in my twenties and was looking to party and be where the action is - and I was really upset because we were so far away from anything fun. I actually wanted to switch hotels but it was too late. We spent a fourtune taxi-ing to center strip, because waiting an hour for a shuttle to take us there never really worked out (especially if you go at nighttime, the shuttles don't run late.) We could have used our taxi money to stay center strip at somewhere equally as nice - and we probably would have got more exercise walking everywhere rather than cabbing (I also love walking.) Also, I didn't like any of the restaurants available - there was low-quality cheap fast food or high-quality super fancy expensive restaurants - nothing in the middle. I wanted great food, plenty of exercise, and to be in the heart of the action - so the palms wasn't for me. \\n\\nHowever - If you're looking for somewhere nice that you can totally relax or gamble off strip at affordable prices, then this is it. I just wasn't in it to relax (or gamble.)\n",

Fine, whatever. I ordered a salad with the grilled chicken on it but the grill was apparently closed. Ok. So I switched it to the salad with the breaded chicken.

We were served on an old lunch tray in styrofoam containers. I'm not one to judge a book by it's cover, but things weren't looking promising.\\n\\nThe salad was boring. Iceberg lettuce, shredded cheddar cheese, a slice of onion, and a little tomato. My FI's wings didn't even have sauce.

      "Review :  Now I had a very bad experience with this groomer. Now the shop owner was sweet at first but in my opinion must have become jaded over her long standing years as pet groomer because when I heard my dog cry out from the back room and asked if it was her lori's answer was \\\"that falls under the category of oh well that's to bad it has to be done\\\" I couldn't believe she said that to me but I kept silent I just knew my dog wasn't one to cry like that anyhow I'm going to make a very long story short and let y'all know that the result of that was my poor baby nails being clipped on one paw way to short so short that they were bleeding however I didn't know until I got home and rinsed her off to make sure she was hair free and the powder she had stopped the bleeding with came off. I'd wondered why my pup was acting so odd and scared. I called Lori and she admitted to the accidentally cutting her nails to short and I'm not one to be an ass but why wouldn't she tell me before I took my dog home where I have a very well taken care of white antique couch? Her unprofessional attitude and smart remarks not to mention very dirty waiting area taught me not to be so quick to trust just anyone with my pooch. The least she could have done was tell me what happened before going home or was it perhaps it was the $12 tip she was afraid id take back well I'll never know because I'll never return to have my dog done there again and I say you don't either. Sorry for dragging you through the mud Lori but in your own words \\\"that falls under the category of that to bad it has to be done\\\"\n",

      "Review :  Although the exercise and sweating is pretty awesome, there are definite issues that are hard to ignore.  First, there is nothing to help new people understand what they should wear or bring with them.  Second, the instructions for what to have in the class are non-existent.  Third, there are so many students in the class and the instructor is all over the place so new people haven't the slightest clue of what to do.  The only way I was able to do at least something was to watch the person next to me.  The instructor provided NO instruction that made sense for beginners and conducted class like everyone was a veteran.  There needs to be separate beginner classes for sure along with some material or something on their web site that explains what you need and should bring.  The instructor should have smaller classes and be cognizant of what special requirements the students need (such as carpal tunnel and alternate positions).  Very disappointed with the setup and lack of instruction.  Also, after 7pm, there is no one manning the front desk and they lock the front door so you'll have to unlock and leave yourself if you happen to leave early.  If you do happen to go, here are some tips: 1) show up 15-20 minutes early your first time for paperwork 2) bring a yoga mat, yoga mat towel, sweat towel and bottle of water 3) highly suggest sports bra of sorts for the women and only shorts (no shirt) for the men 3) wear flip flops or slip-on/off shoes 4) leave purse/valuables/stuff in the car or at home 5) if using a card for payment, get some kind of small wallet that you can clip to your yoga mat or wrist 6) inside the classroom there are no shoes allowed and little or no talking 7) the room is a long rectangle and if a lot of folks are there, be prepared to be close to your neighbor.\n",

But while waiting for some glasses down the way, we needed to decide on something, and other food court fare had even less appeal, so off we went.\\n\\nThe day was a decent one, so we opted to sit on the patio.  Not a good choice.  Apparently they did not have much say in the design of the patio, as it looks like something pulled directly from a Dr. Seuss book - all sorts of crazy angles.  I am really amazed that everything does not fall directly off the table, so some unknown law of gravity must be at work.  Maybe they have the ghost of M. C. Escher on staff.\\n\\nTo make matters worse, this little ten-person patio is way smaller than the dozens (hundreds?  thousands?) of tables inside, so if you get stuck out there, you will probably have horrible service.  If it was just us, I could blow it off as something personal - but it seemed like every table out there was constantly looking around for someone, and more than one actually got up and went inside to ask for someone to come out.\\n\\nAs has been mentioned, the prices are pretty high.  I do not know if this is typically for CPK, as my only comparison is to the locations in an airport, but I do know that for what you get, it is not the best deal.

I don't know if it was the over burnt roast beef, the under cooked chicken, or the shoe leather they tried to pass off as steak, but coming back here after 8 months left a very bad taste in my mouth. My family and I use to come here all the time when I was younger and the food was great, the atmosphere was wonderful and the staff was very friendly.  This use to be the place to be, now I would gladly spend the extra $3 and waist the gas to go to a different golden buffet (Golden Corral).  Do not waist your time and money on this place anymore, Trust me I won't.  I would rather eat out of the dumpster behind Taco Bell than ever eat at this Hometown buffet again.  You have lost a lifetime customer, and anytime your name comes up in conversation, I may just puke.\n",

Working at a food place myself and my boss having owned it we know how things should be in a restaurant. The second my boss looked around she was like nope not eating here. There was pizza dough laying around open on the bottom shelf that looked like it hadn't been cleaned in forever. The soda machine had buildup of some liquid and was leaking at the bottom. Honestly my standards aren't too high with food and I usually have a tough stomach so I said what the heck I'll eat anyways since we didn't have much time.

      "Review :  In the world of cakes, there's somehow an unspoken rule that if it's pretty, it's okay to be subpar in taste and moistness. In my world, this does not compute. It needs to be as tasty as it is pretty. Period.\\n\\nSo I can only give kudos to the artfulness of a Tammie Coe Cake, but nothing more. Cakes where you are told to remove the fondant and then eat it... that's not right--you should be able to eat it all--and yummily so. If you like the taste of fondant... you've got to be kidding me--Yucky!\\n\\nSo take my review or leave it. I just think a cake needs to be tasty and moist first and pretty second... less of course it's for a wedding, than it needs to be both EQUALLY. Who has ever said no to an ugly but great tasting cake? Not me. So I'm putting my foot down and saying I won't eat a cake or cupcake that isn't tasty to me.\\n\\nNow, I must state that I am more a fan of cake than frosting. Frosting is secondary to me. So if you are more for frosting than for cake, ignore my note and have at all the Tammie Coe's and Sprinkles of the world--and have mine... no really, go ahead.\\n\\nIf there IS frosting--for me and others like me, a little bit of frosting goes a long way with one exception: If it's Whipped Cream Frosting... then BRING IT ON! I like frosting's more subtler relative so if it's a Whipped Cream Iced cake, I won't make it a point to get an inside piece, or scrape off the icing at all as I would a basic frosted cake.\\n\\nAnyway, Tammie Coe's cakes or cupcakes don't do it for me. If I have to partake in one of her treats, I'd shoot for her pastries or cookies before cake or cupcake.\\n\\nAs for MJ Bread, I have no complaints there... their breads really impressed. I can't remember which CenPho restaurant I had my first taste of MJ bread, but I remember being V E R Y impressed.\n",

I had the meat trio and my wife had the mushroom risotto.  The meats were well seasoned, but the churico was overcooked and hard like a rock.  The risotto was a bit watery and needed salt badly.  Had to request salt since they dont keep it on the table.  The waitress must have been hired for her ability to wear a miniskirt, because she was very absent during our over 2hr long meal at this place.  The best thing here that we had was the not-so-generous portion of calamari.  It was flash fried to perfection and had the best breading I've had in a while.

Lower level bed did not yield any results so next day I decided to risk it in the bed I purchased. It worked great, though was definitely scary with cracks and bare bulbs.\\n\\nWhen I came back 2 weeks after associate told me I used up all my sessions and she knows nothing about it.

She said in the system I was switched to something else and she couldnt do anything about it.\\n\\nShe did not have manager's contact info, could not give me any refund and could not give me a session per her words. How does one working at a tanning salon have no manager contact info? What if there is fire? Someone burned? Inspection came in?

There was an associate doing makeup on a customer, another associate helping 2 customers, and one gal behind the register dealing with a growing line. The place was buys. I get it, but I wasn't even acknowledged after saying \\\"Excuse me\\\" about 5 times.\\nI'm not a pain in the a$$ customer, and I didn't make a fuss. I felt it was so rude to just be ignored. I wouldn't have minded waiting if I was at least acknowledged, but to be in there for more than 10 minutes without an acknowledgement is totally unacceptable.\n",

      "Review :  I visited Lilly's on Forbes Avenue in Squirrel Hill last week.  I decided to give it a try because several people were eating at the sidewalk tables and the pasta and meatballs looked good with generous portions.  There are pictures on the wall and you order from the wall menu by building your pasta dish in three steps.  It was dinner time so I ordered ziti (step 1) with pink tomato vodka sauce at a hefty price of $9.99 (step 2) and added meatballs (step 3) from the fresh toppings at 2 for $1.49.  I also ordered a large piece of Tiramisu for $4.99.\\n\\nThis was a take out order that cost me 30 minutes of my time.  The wait seemed a bit long but I was hungry and looking forward to enjoying my meal when I got home 15 minutes later.\\n\\nIt was around 7 pm when I ordered this meal on a Wednesday night and they must have been running low on vodka sauce and pasta because both were scarce and what there was of the sauce was bland tasting.  Also, they must have run out of the meatballs I paid for as they were not included in the bag so I can't comment on the taste.  I will say that the young employees they have working there are more concerned with socializing than paying attention to the orders they are filling.  When I got to the dessert, it was half the size of the palm of my hand maybe 4\\\" long and 2\\\" wide and looked smashed up.  I paid $5.00 for a large size so how small must their small size be for $3.00?  The Tiramisu did not taste fresh made.  More like it came out of a generic frozen box.\\n\\nDon't waste your hard earned money here.  Rose Tea Cafe just up the street has better noodles than this place!!!\n",

      "Review :  I also was a first time visitor using a Groupon.  I have to One-Star them because they refused to honor the Groupon.  I print Groupons the day I buy them as a physical, visual reminder to use them.  My day of purchase printed Groupon clearly stated on its face that it's expiration date was December 5.  I ate at the restaurant on December 5, and the management falsely claimed that the Groupon was expired. Beyond the manipulative dishonesty of the management, the food was very mediocre IMHO.  The chicken teriyaki was a frozen skinless boneless chicken breast like you would buy by the bag at costco or sams club, cooked barely long enough to no longer be raw, with no flavoring or seasoning whatsoever.  the vegetables were steamed but also with no flavoring or seasoning whatsoever.  The salmon teriyaki was the same story.  The yakisoba was 180 degrees the opposite direction, too much salty seasoning.  The decor is very nice, and the restaurant has a nice ambiance and vibe, but the mediocre food and bad Groupon experience left a bad taste in my mouth.  We won't be back.\n",

      "Review :  We stayed here for 5 days to visit with our granddaughters from Bay Area CA.  Upon arriving we soon realized that our room had no internet.  I was on the phone with the front desk along with the internet provider for over an hour to no avail.  The next morning they had us move to room C235 (which was a complete inconvenience since we had already unpacked everything!!!).  This room, while directly next to the pool, still had very spotty WIFI and I was constantly getting booted from the internet both on my iphone and my ipad.\\n\\nWhile the pool was nice and the grandchildren enjoyed the Oasis Water Park ($40 per wrist band for extra guests) there was no microwave in the hotel room and the mini fridge (if you can call it that) was so small that nothing fit, and the few things we did put in it (which were leftovers from the Rustlers Roost) along with our beverages were warm in the morning!!!  \\n\\nBottom line......this place might offer you a deal on the room rate, but be very prepared to spend a crapload of money at the \\\"Lobby Bar & Grill\\\", \\\"Rustlers Roost\\\" or \\\"Aunt Chiladas\\\"!!!  They make sure you can't store or prepare food in your room.  I've stayed at some pretty shady motels in my life and they have ALL had a mini fridge with a mini freezer and for the most part a microwave!!!  We were very disappointed in this hotel and will NEVER EVER AGAIN STAY HERE!!\\n\\nOh and don't forget the $40/day resort fee on top of your room rate.....then ad $5/day tax to that!! Really??\\n\\nOh and if you order a movie for the kids it's only good for ONE WATCH, not 24 hours like everywhere else.  Seriously this place is a RIPOFF!!  Do yourself and your family a financial favor and stay in Mesa, then get tickets to Sunsplash for $20/day and put the rest of your money in your back pocket or grab a pizza at 1/4 the cost of that money grabber AZ Grand Resort!

      "Review :  Horrible customer service from the manager... the food is standard Panera Bread quality and not worth a trip back to this location. I walked in on 12/28, Sunday morning, Melissa the cashier was friendly and efficient. Then the manager, who was unorganized, running around (it wasn't busy) and creating a chaotic atmosphere appeared. Her name was Jessica, as I asked the cashier before I left. She didn't smile or offer a greeting to customers, instead she was rudely speaking to the team (complaining about a new person not understanding how to make a drink and being overwhelmed herself). The cashier and another team member were making 2 smoothies which had been ordered, 1 of them was mine. All was good then Jessica haphazardly delegated other tasks to the team members. My smoothie was finished mixing but needed to be poured into a cup. I asked if she could pour mine before moving on to the next one so my order could be completed. She said, \\\"sir I know you want me to be 15 people but I'm only one person!\\\". I responded, \\\"focus on finishing 1 task before moving on to another.\\\" In addition, the team serving the sandwiches is average at best. Engage your team and delight your customers to ensure repeat business and you'll also be able to take down the \\\"now hiring\\\" sign. This Panera is lacking in both areas and I will not be returning, it's simply not worth it in terms of value.\n",

Saturday morning we called the concierge to reserve a table at The Bank for me and my two friends.  We spoke to someone at The Bank who told us we had a table for the three of us, informing us to arrive at 11pm sharp to get the table.\\n\\nThat night the three of us showed up at 10:45pm, waited for about 45 minutes, and were finally brought to our \\\"table.\\\"  Our \\\"table\\\" turned out to be the end of the bar, where we were expected to stand while we enjoyed our $475 bottle of Vodka.\\n\\nBefore even being \\\"seated\\\" I told our host that we reserved a table.  The end of the bar wasn't a table.  He said they were very busy and couldn't sit us down just yet.  We ordered a bottle and two hours later still didn't have a table.  After trying to find someone to talk to for a long time, we gave up and left.\\n\\nI disputed the charge on my credit card for $651 with the GM of The Bank.  Everyone knows that you pay for a table, not a bottle.  I wouldn't order a bottle for $475 + tax and tip if I were going to sit at the bar.  The bottle is a proxy for a table. The GM offered me complimentary tables on an off night for their mistake.  I declined with the intention of getting my money back.\\n\\nAfter several back-and-forth conversations with multiple people at the Bellagio and The Bank, I decided to bring the dispute to my credit card.  After a few months I just learned that my credit card company won't give back the charge.\\n\\nI'm rating The Bank a 1 out of 5 for having bad service.  They told me during the dispute that tables have a 3-bottle minimum.  Had I known about this minimum before or during my visit, I would have spent my money at a different club.  They completely screwed my friends and me by charging us the equivalent of a table without actually giving us a table.  Furthermore, I totally would have bought three bottles had I known that's what it would take to get a table.\\n\\nI'll never come here again because of how they treated my group and me.

      "Review :  Went there with my husband and 2 kids. We are of Mexican decent and in there all you see is white people. They look at you weird or you catch them looking at you and pretend they weren't. Now for our waitress, I hate when she serves us. She is so snotty and looks at us bad she seems like she has no patience for Hispanic people because once she turns around to a table with white people she is all smiles. I just feel so uncomfortable at that place that every time my husband wants to go I remember her. I gave it a last chance this weekend and still the same.  She's a white woman with green or blue eyes and red short hair.. just warning you if your Hispanic and you go there. If you are Anglo she will like you. Now for The food. . Its alright but doesn't have the real Mexican food feeling to it. The rest of the people who work there are nice and give you chips and salsa.. which I do like the salsa! Hope that if you go there you don't feel as uncomfortable as I do in there. The weird part for me is that I feel so uncomfortable in a \\\"Mexican food\\\"  and I'm Mexican. To be honest I do not recommend it the food is not worth going through what I did. Sorry Los compadres but I gave you many chances.\n",

You can tell from the moment you walk in (cardboard handwritten signs screaming no return/ not responsible for food issues) that maybe you should turn around and leave. I however made the mistake of staying. I purchased the beef teriyaki combo (which was rung up wrong and had to be fixed after I waited for my food for 20 mins). The beef was over cooked and too lightly sauced, the rice was bland and carrots overcooked into mush. Not worth the stomach ache I had the rest of the day.\n",

We went on one of the nights they had wristbands. My friend got the gold one which meant free drinks for her and we got the regular wrist bands - 50% off.. still an amazing deal! It just sucked that they were so packed. It was difficult to order drinks on multiple occasions because there's always so many people at the bars. It's also impossible to walk around because it's so crowded! The dance floor is also hard to move around! The music wasn't always so great though. It was always a mix of 80s-90s hip hop with a couple current hits mixed in. Very strange to dance to but it was still fun. I miss the old days before this place got so popular but I guess that's good for them.\n",

      "Review :  Where to begin...I think I will start with the positive.   The brie brulee topped with the caramelized apple slices was a hit, the mixed green salad with goat cheese was awesome and the pear tart desert was outstanding.  The lamb shank was cooked perfectly, but the lamb flavor was missing.   The whole dish ( lamb shank, veggies, Israeli couscous, figs and apricots) ALL had the exact same flavor; only the textures were different.   Now the flavor was great, but not something I would write home about.   Now to the negative stuff...The place was too crowded and noisy for my liking. The tables were so close that I felt I could join in the conversation next to me without effort. Couple that with REALLY REALLY slow service and, well you get the idea.   You will need to bring your own wine and they will open it for you for only $10.00.  French food without wine?   really??  And then you gaff me for 10 bucks?!?  Needless to say I had the minted tea. It was okay but no real mint flavor to speak of.   The final bill for one appetizer, one salad, one entree and one desert was $70.00. (Not counting the tip)  My date and I split everything and we were comfortably well fed. So, the portion size was decent.   To sum up, it would be a nice place for a date, but I won't be back and I know a place not to far from there that I would MUCH rather go to given the choice.\n",

After being told my computer was broken, I waited 45 minutes even though I told them the exact computer I wanted to buy. I was willing to pay $2,000 upfront to get the computer I needed. When it came time to purchase it, I let them know I needed it ASAP since I had to make it to class. At this point, they told me it would be ANOTHER 30 minutes for me to even get the computer!!!! Not to mention, I dealt with a total witch while trying to explain I had been at the store already for 45 minutes waiting to get this computer.

      "Review :  What is there to love about Toby Keith's Bar & Grill? Not a whole lot.\\n\\nMy family and I had dinner at TK's last night as an alternative to Guy Fieri's who 1. Doesn't take reservations and 2. Wanted us to wait 2 hours to eat. Ha ha! No thanks Guy. And BTW - no reservations? Come on.\\n\\nFirst TK's has a fun atmosphere, but looks like a normal 'ol bar and grill. The walls are decorated with Toby Keith... things, and all the girls wear panties and chaps. Ass in your face every time your server leaves your table. Speaking of service, it could be improved. After we were seated we waited a good 10 minutes to put our order in, luckily, since we all had sufficient time we all knew what we wanted to eat and drink.\\n\\nOnward to the food - steak fajitas, which came out sizzling and made me excited. But when were placed in front of me were a let down. The beef was haphazardly cut and chunky, not strips. Plus the meat was not seasoned in anyway and it looked just WRONG to me. Fajitas come with your choice of corn or flour tortillas. I picked corn - half of them were not steamed enough and had hard edges. They brought them out in a tortilla holder with NO LID. What the heck? No wonder it did not steam all the way. Dear manager of TK's: put lids on your tortilla holders and customers will get tortillas that are soft! My fajitas also came with: rice (OK), refried beans (OK), salsa (not spicy at all), guac (OK), and sour scream (OK). Overall what could be a great dish, only mediocre.\\n\\nNext - \\\"I Love This Bar\\\" BBQ Sandwich - my mother requested no sides for her sandwich, but they brought her fries anyway. She said the BBQ sandwhich could use more BBQ sauce. \\n\\nChicken Fried Steak - My brother had this and said it was so-so, not a REAL chicken fried steak in my family's opinion because it didn't appear to be pan-fried, which is the honest way to make a chicken fried steak - not deep frying it with a lot of breading. Speaking of breading...\\n\\nMy husband's fish and chips were mostly breading which he peeled off so he could actually eat the fish.\\n\\nLastly, the shrimp appetizer which my father ordered for his meal came with a HUGE amount of deep fried little shrimp. There had to have been 20 and it came with a tasty, creamy cajun-flavored dipping sauce. I really liked the shrimp.\\n\\nOverall - I feel as though there could be a lot of improvement. I like Toby Keith. I like the idea of the restaurant - I really like all the country music they were playing, but the food was a huge downer.\n",

      "Review :  I'm from out of town and was visiting relatives who lived near this salon. I went there looking for a Shellac Manicure. I've been having CND Shellac Manicures for over a year and I would NEVER recommend that anyone have this manicure done there.\\n\\nFirst off, they totally buffed my nails with a very coarse buffer. I asked why they were scraping up my nails and they said that the polish holds on better to the nail if it is roughly buffed (my salon at home does not do this, in fact thier CND rep told them not to buff at all), I wish I told them to stop but I let them continue.\\n\\nAfter returning home and going to my normal salon to take off the polish, my nail salon had the hardest time taking off the polish (even after soaking acetone!). Turns out Highland Nails put on a gel polish base coat like they use when you put on Gel Nails, not the CND base coat. Which explains why they ripped up my nails so the the polish will stay longer. My nails were literally stained red as well. \\n\\nAlso, they did not use the recommended curing times between coats - they didn't time it at all. They just stick your hands in the UV boxes and let you sit there. So, obviously, they don't really know what they are doing do they care for their client's nail \\\"health\\\". \\n\\nCombine this with the fact that 3 different people \\\"tag-teamed\\\" my manicure & pedicure....I would tell people spend their money elsewhere, you're paying alot for mani & pedi so go to a salon who knows what they are doing.\n",

      "Review :  On my last visit to Las Vegas, I had breakfast at the Henry on two separate occasions.  The Henry has been a regular breakfast stop every time I'd stayed at the Cosmopolitan.  It had been, up until now, a model of consistency given its high-end 24-hour casino diner status.  However, both visits on this trip provided wildly different experiences, which also offered two distinct data points indicating that things are amiss at the Henry.\\n\\nFirst, good, consistent service has noticeably slipped.  On Saturday morning around 11am with a party of six, our service was fast, friendly and attentive.  On Tuesday morning around 10am, service was largely AWOL as it took over 25 minutes for our breakfasts to come out after placing our orders with no interim stops at our table by our server to check up on us or to explain/apologize for the excessive wait for our food.  Second, the food quality, execution, and portion sizes have nosedived.  I had the Short Rib Benedict ($19) on Saturday.  While it was still a tender, flavorful, and savory hunk of meat, it was noticeably a much smaller portion than I'd received on previous trips to the Henry.  The short rib isn't served atop an English muffin, but instead a potato hash.  However, this time the hash was desiccated, crispy, flavorless, and not very appetizing.  It wasn't a good result for this previously awesome dish.  On Tuesday, I had the Breakfast Burrito ($16).  It, too, was noticeably smaller than I remembered.  More damning was that after the excessive wait to get it, the burrito was only warm, not hot, and seemingly soggy and limp.  It had likely sat around for a while before being brought out to me.  However, the ultimate failure was that I bit into a foreign object, an inch-long sliver of clear plastic, found in the center of my burrito.  While the server did the right (and only) thing and took my burrito of our bill, it was really too late to recover from an awful experience.   At least the Illy coffee that they serve was good and hot on both visits.\\n\\nEveryone has an off day.  That said, the slippage at the Henry is painfully apparent.  While I will stay at the Cosmopolitan again, the same can't be said about a return visit to the Henry.\n",

Answers to come..\\n\\nHow much should price factor into yelp* ratings?  Price should factor only into the quality of food, not quantity.  They give more food than you can eat, but the limiting factor is the quality.  \\n\\nVegetables - they come from the back kitchen where we don't see it getting made.  The vegetables have definitely been overcooked.  If you can pull a discernible texture from each veggie in there, props to you.  Carrots, zuchini, brocolli, bok choi, all tasted the same and had same texture.  I don't even know why it's in there - it hardly plays off the rice/protein.  Perhaps if the veggies still had a little crunch in them and weren't soggy and soaked for hours it would go well. I'm just saying.\\n\\nChicken/Rice - average but nothing spectacular.  Anytime chicken is cut into small pieces when it could be served in larger pieces, the protein is suspect.  \\n\\nWould I go here again? I don't think so.

      "Review :  My girlfriend has been a regular of this place for years and could not wait to take me when I came in town for the Steelers game. We did not make a reservation and showed up on a busy saturday night around 8:45pm fully expecting a long wait. My girlfriend had forewarned me that there will be a wait so when we showed up we just expected to put our names down and go across the street for a drink while we waited. We ended up waiting in the front of the restaurant for ~20 minutes without anyone taking down our name. A few waitresses mentioned that the older italian guy (owner) took down names. We were ignored several times by him as he came up front - no biggie we saw it was busy. An older woman came up to us several times and asked if we had been helped, we replied no, and she reiterated that the older man dealt with the \\\"list\\\". We were fine up through now and were still waiting when the older guy came up to the front and shoved the older woman (his wife?) and proceeded to scream at her for several minutes. The entire restaurant went quiet and was staring at the front of the restaurant (where we were awkwardly standing as well). The older gentleman was screaming that she was always interfering with the list and he was done with it. He kept going on and said that why did she even care about a couple of \\\"out of towners\\\" who will never come back again. (which was even more shocking because my girlfriend was a regular and had regularly conversed with the man many times before). \\n\\nWe subsequently left while the man was still screaming at the woman. This was the most absurd display at a restaurant I have ever seen. My girlfriend was extremely upset especially for the physical violence the man was displaying. This was no casual shove but rather a full two handed violent push followed by pounding his fist on the table and screaming at the woman in front of the entire restaurant. Needless to say we will never come back and recommend people boycott a place where the owner treats his (wife/employee) with such disrespect regardless of how stressed he may be on a busy night.\n",

Mine, on the other hand, was the worst Chamango I've ever had :(  It was started w/ Chamoy on the bottom then large chunks of fresh mango, then 2 scoops of some mango sorbet then more large chunks of mango. In between there all that there were layers of Chamoy. I think I counted 3 ice cubes and then it was topped off w/ Chamoy, a fork and that straw thing w/ spicy stuff (OMG, I grew up in San Diego, you'd think I'd know the proper terms :T). I'm used to the mango blended w/ ice and sugar then layered w/ the Chamoy and enjoying through a straw, this was too much work and overly sweet! \\n\\nI was super disappointed especially since when you try to yelp/search for places like this here in Vegas, we got some slim pickins!\\n\\nWe'll be back, but I'll have a go at something other my beloved Chamango.\n",

      "Review :  One of their employees commented to me that they are instructed by management not to clean up or buss the few tables in this dinky cafe, \\\"because the patrons would then expect it\\\", rather than learn to do it themselves.\\n\\nWhen they are busy, they set the just-cooked food on a small counter top that is used by customers for dirty dishes.  Often, you have been given a \\\"buzzer\\\" which they activate when they set your food on this \\\"dirty\\\"counter.  At certain times of year, there well inevitably be flies on your food when you pick it up to take to your table, as, weather permitting, they have the doors to outside wide open.\\n\\nSo, I would say the place is often unhygienic and disorganized, even though it has only about five tables inside.\\n\\nIn spite of the above, the food itself is quite good.  This is another of the facilities associated with Trilogy that, having a captive customer base, is truly not at all competitive with the \\\"outside world\\\".\\n\\nAlso, many somewhat elderly residents come into this cramped space soaked with sweat immediately after working out in the exercise facility just down the hall, and are often extremely loud.\\n\\nAnd, believe it or not, the dinky little cafe has the major walking traffic from the parking lot to the pool running between the tables, so that groups of people in bathing suits and carrying all sorts of pool paraphernalia \\\"squeeze\\\" past you as you are eating.\\n\\nThis may be the poorest design for a cafe I have EVER seen.\\n\\nToo bad the place is not better because a really good place would be very busy.

I've been to the new location a few times and it seems like they have lost their touch. Maybe the coziness of the former location added to the charm?\\n\\nOn my first trip to the new location, my husband and I had breakfast. I ordered a breakfast sandwich which was served on Layer's version of a croissant. I must say it was one of the oddest combinations. The croissant was not tradionally fluffy, but was overly greasy and so flaky that it fell apart and left my fingers dripping of oil. I could not even cut it with a knife, it just made an even bigger mess. After a few bites, I started to think my taste buds were off because the flavors just did not jive. When my husband tried it - he agreed. We realized that sandwich had a horseradish-like spread... yuck! He also was not impressed by his breakfast quiche. I find it a bit arrogant that there was a comment made by Layers management that their flavor combinations should not be questionned... maybe they should listen to customers!\\n\\nThe other issue I have is bussing your own dishes is awkward and inconvenient, especially when we spent over $20 on breakfast.

When I went up for a refund (we had finished our meals) a guy at the till apologised a few times and said he didn't know anything about the order. The girl did, but again, refused to look at me or say sorry. Another guy came from the kitchen, also apologised and asked how I'd like my refund. Again, standing next to him, she had a chance to say sorry to me or even to him but never did.

The burrito is the best I've had in Edinburgh. It's also probably the biggest for the cheapest in the quickest time. I would recommend the steak burrito with spicy salsa. It's huge though so you probably don't need to order a side dish to yourself but maybe one to share. I ahem..ordered buffalo wings for myself which are also great but very spicy, I'd recommend a beer or two to cool down with.

The portions were good, the sauce was yummy and the chicken was seasoned well. \\n\\nSo we eat and get the check when my friend notices an extra charge on there for $1.50. After combing over the bill we are perplexed at what that charge is for, so we ask the waitress. Well apparently a second helping of chips and salsa in not free at Tony's. WTF?\\n\\nWhy this REALLY irritates me is three-fold. First  if you are served chips and salsa without asking when you sit down at the table, it sets the precedence that chips and salsa are complimentary. I mean pretty much every Mexican Restaurant does it these days so its not a far stretch to assume this. Second. the waitress did not mention there was an extra charge for a second helping. That would have been nice. Duh!  Finally the serving of chips and salsa we were served was minuscule. At a $1.50 we were overcharged for the portion, I am sure their cost was something like 7 cents.\\n\\nThat leaves me to feel like they pulled a bait and switch. Too bad, I really liked my lunch. The hair-brained policy of charging for small portions of chips and salsa cost you a star and you lose another for the waitress not saying anything to our party about it.\n",

      "Review :  Well I used to like this mall, however, they have \\\"new\\\" owners.The prior owner and manager turned out to be a real crook and stole revenue from many dealers. This all happened about a year - year and half ago. After a big fallout, nearly half the mall moved out. Enter the \\\"new\\\" owners, who I hear are from Texas? These people have tons of stuff, that apparently they have been selling out of state prior, most of it is from their own collections one could gather?  Slowly they have been staging their merchandise to look like individual collections and dealers for months. Over the past year what was left of the original dealers have since moved out, to other malls. The prices are higher than all the malls in Arizona. Perhaps they think they are in California? Santa Fe? They run an Auction service through the mall, but be careful, a good amount of the action items come from the floors and walls of the mall. They also have an Antique Store on eBay under the store name: Continental Collectibles and under the seller name of azantiquecentre. Just check out there eBay approval rating...OVER 500 NEGATIVE ratings from customers. It's almost unheard of to have a rating under 90% (their rating is 87%) on eBay without doing something wrong. Pretty sad if you ask me?  So this afternoon I venture into their store, I have not been in the place for 6-8 months prior. On my way out, I was \\\"Detained\\\" because they thought I had stolen a piece of art on July 1st. They had a blurry security camera photo that was kinda close but as I pointed out, without my reading glasses on, that there were MAJOR differences. But they called the Scottsdale police anyway. I'm 68 year old male and have never been arrested for anything in my life. I was shocked that they would not spend a few seconds comparing the photo with the person standing in front of them. After an hour of questioning and harassment the cops let me go. A bad experience in a bad Antique Mall that will remain bad as long as it's current owners and manger run it. If you don't think so, then just ask all of the former dealers that use to rent spaces from them. Currently I think there are maybe three or four left. 90% of that inventory comes from these \\\"new\\\" owners.\n",

Martinis good, steaks very average.We got one basket of bread for four and requested more at least 6 times and received none even after being told it would be right out. Asked for waters at least 6 times and did not get one glass. The waitress had no help bussing or serving water if asked. There we sat with no bread for quite awhile. Then some people from the kitchen brought our salads. about two minutes later the dinners showed up. The fries were extra soggy. We will not be back to this way over priced restaurant. You are much better off going to another Station Casino restaurant like Sonoma at Sunset Station or the Broiler at Boulder Station for atmosphere and value.\n",

      "Review :  It is with a heavy heart that I give Craftsteak two stars.  Part of it was expectations, and part of it is the actual experience.\\n\\nExpectations: Top-notch service, tasty food, atmosphere, advice on wine.\\n\\nExpectations met on... atmosphere and wine.  The Malbec that the sommelier recommended was really and truly delicious.  \\n\\nExpectations not met on... service or food.  The appetizers (scallops!) and the lobster were fantastic, but this is Craftsteak.  I expected out-of-this-world steak, and we were sorely disappointed.  The ribeye we got must've been a bad cut, because the best word I can think of is 'grisly.'  Points to the staff because when we mentioned it, they did take a little off the bill.  I would've rather gotten a bite of good ribeye, but whatevs.\\n\\nThe dessert was awesome.  If I go again, I'll have an appetizer and dessert!\\n\\nThe service started out like any high-end dining experience, but then things got weird.  We got a sort of family style four-course meal that included multiple appetizers, salads, entrees, and desserts.  It's a little annoying to have three entrees brought out at once - for two people.  We couldn't possibly eat everything while it was hot, so that was LAME.  We felt this way on every course - we couldn't enjoy and take our time, we had to stuff our face before stuff got cold.  Our server also mysteriously disappeared after the orders were taken until the meal was over.  \\n\\nWe actually refilled our own wine glasses.  After waiting about 10 minutes to see if the server would be back (as expected at high-end places, or am I off-base?).  When they were nowhere to be found, we took matters into our own hands.\\n\\nI can't say I'll be back anytime soon - there are so many great restaurants in Vegas!  I would skip Craftsteak.\n",

The restaurant had a beautiful view of the strip, and a wonderful waitstaff.  The food was very good, although pricey and we did feel that for those prices we've had better food in other restaurants.  But what really put a damper on an otherwise lovely evening was when my son bit down on a bone in what was supposed to be a boneless dish of rabbit.  The waitstaff was quick to send over a manager to check on him and take his information should he have needed to have anything done, but the damage was already done.  He had such pain in his tooth and jaw that he left the restaurant early to go back up to the room, which just ruined the meal for the rest of us.\n",

      "Review :  You have to be kidding me! All the buzz about this place is way over rated!\\n\\nThe best part of the place is the place itself. Cool design, innovative, comfortable (if you overlook the AC running at 65 F).\\n\\nShort and poor selection of wines, the menu doesn't make sense, the deserts are poor executed, service barely OK and all of this with a way overpriced tag.\\n\\nCheese bread at the beginning was good, probably the best executed dish (puzzle face).\\n\\nI had a glass of a French wine which had one of the most awkward wine tastes I've ever tried, but again, the selection is not that great.\\n\\nIn their web they have a beet salad but I didn't find it in the menu. It seems that they replaced the beets for strawberries. When I asked why, apparently beets are out of season. (Really? I'm not a farmer, but I had beets last weekend in another restaurant, oh well). Salad was barely average.\\n\\nThen I had the marrow bone. It was OK, I was expecting a little more of a flavor from the onion jam and the bread used was kind of boring for such a dish.\\n\\nFor desert I had the rum and coke. It should be called sweet bread. No taste of rum or coke what so ever. Just a spongy bread super sweet with whipped cream on the side with an unknown flavor and a jelly with a hint of lime.\\n\\nI also tried the doughnuts with chocolate. The doughnuts (bites) were crunchy (in a bad way) and the chocolate was more in the side of dark than milk, so didn't love them either.\\n\\nThere was a guitar player for all the three tables and 4 people that were at the bar.

I know this will sound silly and like I'm exaggerating, but I truly felt like none of them had ever organized/worked a concert before.  It was absolute chaos.  I go to concerts all the time and this was by far the worst experience I've had with a venue and their ability to fairly and effectively manage the crowd.  Lots of people were waiting all day long before the show started and hours later, closer to showtime, the whole line was moved around about 8 or 9 times.  One guy would tell us we were all in the wrong place and needed to line up by the escalators, then someone else would lead us to a different spot in the casino, then back in front of the venue again, and it went on and on and on.  This whole time the line was getting messed up and people were running around like crazy trying to make sure they didn't get screwed out of their spot.  Once they finally decided where to put us, half the people were facing in one direction and half in the other direction.  The staff couldn't even decide where the front of the line was!  It was so ridiculous none of us could believe it.  \\n\\nThey continued to be completely unorganized and when we were finally let into the venue, they destroyed the line again by holding back the right side & letting tons of people from the left go in...and then did the same to the other side.  Do these people not understand the point of lining up??  It's not just for fun, it's because we all spent many hours trying to ensure a great spot.  Telling us \\\"every spot is a good spot\\\" is irrelevant and makes it clear that you don't understand at ALL.  \\n\\nOh I forgot to mention the best part.  To even get into this line that would be let in first, they force you to spend $20 in their store or restaurant to get a pass in.  So if you're a huge fan of whoever is playing, just know that the 'Pass The Line' people will be let in before you unless you shell out an additional $20.  Way to pray on the fans, make a quick buck, and then treat us like crap, HOB.  Not amused at all.\\n\\nI hope Brandon never plays here again, because he's the only musician I'd go through this for again.

      "Review :  DO NOT GO!  I took my Pomeranian there to be groomed.  They were given very SPECIFIC instruction's on how I wanted her groomed, including length of the body, and to just trim the face, leaving her with some fluff and fullness around the face as a Pom should be.  When I picked her up, the groomer had completely shaved her entire body, including around her face.  When I asked why she looked this way the answer the groomer gave me was \\\"I groom pom's like fox's.\\\"  This was a blatant disregard for what I (the customer) had specifically asked for.  When I spoke to the manager and told her I was completely unsatisfied with how she looked and that my instructions were completely disregarded her answer was \\\"do you want me to fix it?\\\"  Fix it?!  What is there to fix?  There is no hair left!  So I said \\\"no I don't want you to cut anymore off\\\" (she would look completely bald).  Then she said \\\"well what do you want me to do?\\\"  I said \\\"well I'm an unsatisfied customer, what do you do when that happens?\\\"  She said she would give me a discount on my next grooming.  I said \\\"I paid for this grooming, which was atrocious, not my dogs next grooming.\\\"  Then she says \\\"well it sounds like you just want to complain and not let me fix it.\\\"  I said \\\"what is there to fix?  Again, she has NO hair left!\\\"  So then she says \\\"well do you want a refund?  Would that make you happy?\\\"  I said yes that would make me very happy.  Her reply \\\"well I just can't do that.\\\"  Ok, so then why was that offered to me?  So, aside from the horrible grooming and terrible customer service, the place is also very dirty and it's more than obvious that the groomers are not well trained in how to groom certain breeds of dogs, as well as the fact that they completely disregard any grooming instructions you give them.\n",

Street food is not always fun. Some people say, it's better than Chipotle and that 2 tacos at Las Palmas are sufficient for a meal. Really a meal or a snack? I am never able to finish chipotle's bowl in one go, there is always some leftover for another meal but 2 tacos were not enough for me. People eat up!  I would never be disappointed with Chipotle's portions and fine guacamole and mild salsa - such clean, fine and flavorful preparations. Most of the time I go for veg options as I love the free guacamole that comes with it at chipotle, as guac is so good.

      "Review :  I am really disappointed because we LOVE this place. We haven't been to eat very often but when I get a craving for spicy, delicious, rich curry this is the place that comes to mind. We seek it out during festivals and outings in the neighborhood. This time, it just wasn't the same. The place was full, and it looked like most of the people sitting already had something to eat in front of them. We were brought half full waters without ice, which struck me as odd because everyone around us had full ice waters, and all the people that sat after us were given full ice water so I don't know what that was about. We ordered quickly. I ordered the Squash Curry and my husband ordered by name the Gang Phet by name. We had ordered these dishes before and we knew what we were expecting, we both ordered medium-hot because on a previous visit we had ordered hot and it was enough to make my eyes water, which I like but wasn't in the mood for. We got our rice. Literally 15 minutes after getting our rice my husband's dish came out, about 7 minutes after than mine came out. My husband opened his pot and poured it out and it didn't look right. It had potatoes and snow peas and a very, very, very light sauce, not the Gang Phet we knew. We let a server know that we thought he received the wrong dish and she insisted that it was correct, but when I got home I looked at the menu and it was not correct, this makes me so disappointed, why lie to your customers? To avoid making them what they actually wanted and ordered? His food wasn't hot by the time we started eating, though it may have been because of the ice cold rice we were eating it with. My squash curry was wonderful, but it did seem more watery, as did his. I guess we need to find another place to enjoy delicious, rich curries from now on.\n",

There were times when the pressure was fine- like in the very beginning when she asked- but then it was so light it was almost tickling! She seemed to want to focus on areas other than requested and seemed to need to use a stool to sit down a lot. It really felt like she wasn't into it so as awkward as it was- I asked her to stop. When I went to check out, I stood at the desk for over 5 minutes while 2 ladies behind the desk were on the phone. I was surprised by their lack of interest that the massage was substandard and they proceeded to charge me. I guess I'm grateful it was only the $30 for 30 minutes of massage but there was a sign in front of me that 'if your massage was unsatisfactory, let us know so we can make it right for you' That did not happen.

I've been here one and a half times: once for dinner, and once attempting lunch but we didn't stay.\\nThe dinner was pretty good. I had the steak salad and it was good, but over-priced for the amount of steak.

Other than the salad, we shared an app, but I can't remember what it was. Meaning it was probably average. My husband had the pork sandwich and said it was really good. All in all, decent food and good service. Ambiance gets a D- it's like eating in one gigantic, loud, dark room with no decor. I can't remember the decor or style in there either. The only way I can describe it is dark and dark. \\nThe lunch we attempted was after we tried to hit True Food at 1p and there was still a 30 minute wait. My friend and I both have little ones and weren't interested in waiting in the 110 heat for lunch. We walked into an empty TK's and sat down...only to find out they were out of high chairs. Yes, it was empty, save the one woman with her one child and the three other high chairs she was saving for friends. Not only does the place apparently only have 3 high chairs, but there was zero attempt to accommodate us otherwise. No offer of boosters, no apology, no nothing. Just a shrug and a...and that was it.

I tried a little off of everyone's plate, and across the board it was so-so.  Nothing inspired me, nothing stood out.  While it's still better than Taco Bell, it really seemed like they were phoning it in.  There was no symphony of flavors, nothing unexpected. \\n\\nAll in all, this is a good place to take your East Coast relatives who can't handle spice, for a stereotypical Mexican meal.  It's kind of like the Disney version of Mexico.  For natives like myself, especially those who either cook their own food, or love a little spice and excitement, don't waste your time.\n",

      "Review :  MUCH BETTER IN VEGAS THAN THIS PLACE!  Don't waste your money, my wife and I have been to many other great restaurants in Vegas and this certainly is not one!  First of, the location sucks as it is next to the buffet in the convention center part of the property.  Second, the entertainment is average at best and that is if you get seated in the only area of the place that could actually see most of it.  BEWARE - the other thing they don't advertise is that the entertainment is not FREE!  You would think it would be part of the obscene food/drink prices but NO, you get hit with a charge for Live Entertainment..probably mandated but they should let you know these things..Finally, the service was terrible..had to continually wait for them to fill our wine glasses, took 15 minutes to get the check and then approx another 15 minutes to get it finalized!\\n\\nThe only decent part of the place was the food and decor.  Again, it was \\\"decent\\\" at best!  They push the caviar flatbread...we could hardly tell if there was caviar on it or not...just one big egg spread over top of everything else...\n",

      "Review :  They stopped making Canolis and they are inside of Anthony's it looks terrible with the checkered table cloths in Anthony's. It just looks weird to have this place inside a fine dining place.  You get confused as to Anthony's or Marinelli's. I do not like the high tables, very uncomfortable. It took Anthony's down several notches in my book!!! Just not the same.\n",

      "Review :  Yep, it is a bar.  So it is loud, noisy and crowded...and many people were apparently enjoying it.  I am not knocking it, but I just do not like to pay Ruth's Chris prices for what is clearly a bar.\\n\\nI would have more impressed all the way around if they had remembered our reservation that was taken by the manager.  Given that we had a reservation for our party of ten, and given that the manager took it, you would have thought that the greeters would have been at least somewhat aware of this and had a table kind of ready....but it was not to be.  \\n\\nSome 45 minutes after our reservation, we were finally seated.  The food was ok.  One of my guests thought the food was way too salty.  I thought it was way to blah, especially given the prices.  One of the couples in our party had to wait a little extra because they had burned the first crispy chicken pizza that they had ordered.  At least they didn't try to serve burnt food!  In any event, as I write this review some four hours later, my stomach is twisting and turning so something I ate there tonight did not agree with me.  \\n\\nI will not be back.  They can keep this loud, overpriced bar slash restaurant.\n",

      "Review :  1st trip about 2 months ago was pretty good.  Was there again today and service was poor.  Ordered eggs over medium, were served like they were hockey pucks...told the waitress and she said she would get new eggs for us, but left the our plates on the table for the next 10 minutes letting the ham, hash browns and English muffins get cold.  Why would they NOT put the plates back under the warmer in the kitchen until the eggs were ready?  Manager came over and said she understood the eggs were made incorrectly, I asked her why they would leave our plates on the table...she said 'sorry' and that was it.  Did not offer to offset the bill, nothing, nada, zippo - so I just had to limit my tip and left a note on the receipt saying \\\"Cold food today - not good\\\".\\n\\nHow do you screw up eggs?  Ask US Egg....very disappointing.\n",

The Manicurist chose to ignore my knocking, but the customer there said something to her, and looked my direction. I obtained their phone number and called. The woman who answered apologized for locking the door and said she would come let me in. However, as she opened the door for me, she smiled and said, \\\"We closed for the day. Sorry.\\\" o.O Outstanding service.\n",
